"Global Africa":  
A Critical Genealogy of a Militant Concept History, diasporas, Pan-Africanism, Reparations, UNESCO's General History of 
Africa While the term Global Africa seems to be increasingly used in sectors as diverse as art, fashion, banking, services and academic research to evoke the multiple connections between Africa and the world, it is worth returning to the activist origins of this term. Indeed, the term stems directly from African and international activism of the early 1990s, which claimed the right to reparations for slavery and colonialism. One step further, the term can be almost superimposed on the social and political history of Pan-Africanism over several centuries and across spaces. The author adopts a pedagogical approach that presents two salient works on the subject (by A. Mazrui and M. O. West) and mobilizes a multilingual and multidisciplinary bibliography to analyse the term in order to clarify the project and the struggles underpinning its use. The article covers the critical origins of Global Africa from its militant emergence to its institutionalization by the African Union and UNESCO. It argues that the stakes are high and the key issue is to grasp the changes in the way we think and represent Africa and Africans in our globalised world.

A Critical Genealogy of a 
Militant Concept 
 
The          expression             Global      Africa,     in             English,   appears  more       and more                regularly in             a              wide range      of             areas.      It             is             mainly    used        to illustrate            the          relationships          and interconnections   between Africa      and         the          world.     Many       establishments      indeed    bear the  term        in             their names,    such        as            a              car           park        in             Cape       Verde, a  bank       in             Malta      or            a construction           company in             South      Africa. More           significantly,           several    highprofile             events     and publications           have        helped    spread    the          expression             in             the cultural,           intellectual             and scientific fields.      For          instance, The         Global     Africa      Project,   a              major      exhibition               curated   by Lowery Stokes     Sims        and         Leslie      King-Hammond,    presented at          the          Museum of             Arts         and         Design    in New        York        in             2011, aimed           to             show       the          extent     to             which      contemporary        African art transcends             the          continent's             geographical          boundaries (Colard,              2012).    The         French-language   book by            Laura      Eboa Songue          and         Paola       Audrey   Ndengue,                Global      Africa      :               150          personnalités qui           font         la             mode       africaine  en            2016,       features  men and women   who         have        contributed            to the          "development of    Afro         fashion",  both        within     and         outside   the          continent (2016,   p.             8).           In the          same       year,        academic                publisher               Taylor     & Francis                launched a              new         series      called Global     Africa,     edited by Toyin       Falola      and         Roy          Doron,     that         has          since       featured 23 books.                The series      aims        to             "place     African    experiences           within the              fields       of             global      history,    globalization, African    Diaspora and         
Atlantic   History".1                 Dorothy  L.             Hodgson and         Judith A.  Byfield    published               a              large       collective volume   the          following year,       entitled   Global      Africa:     Into         the           Twenty-First           Century. It              aimed     to demonstrate          that         Africa      has          a              long         history    of interactions.       On           that         account,  the continent                should    be placed                at             the          center     of             global      historical                processes               rather than        on            its            periphery.              The         contributions         of             some       forty researchers,  artists,     journalists, activists  and         writers    aimed to establish that         Africa      is             not          an            exotic      space      outside   of history  -  without              obscuring               the          unequal  power     relations that continue         to             structure many African    communities'         living conditions    (Hodgson               and         Byfield,   2017,      p.             6).           Other      recent references              contribute              to             a              similar    intellectual             project, albeit        without   the          title         Global Africa      (Kaag      et             al.,            2021),    or with    it,             such        as            a              special    issue       of             African Diaspora (de          Witte and               Spronk,   2014)     or            then        again,      this          new         journal    this          article is published               in.            These      examples                illustrate the          growing, widespread            and         accepted use          of the          term        Global      Africa      to express              the          idea         that         Africa      must       be            studied   and understood through             its            interactions            and         interconnections   with the  world.     As            historian Paul Tiyambe Zeleza     had         already pointed     out,          questions               related    to             Africa's   place       in             the          world and         the          world's   place       in             Africa,     as            well         as            the          intersection between            world      and African    history,    prove      to             be            a              promising field      (Zeleza,   2010,      p.             16). 
However, the          popularization       of             these       cultural,  intellectual and     scientific uses        of             the          term        Global Africa      seems     to             obscure  a              particular               dimension associated           with        it.             In            fact, this expression             derives   directly from          the          early       1990s     African    and Pan-African    mobilization,          which demanded             the          right        to             reparations for       slavery    and         colonialism.            It             can be     found      in the          sources,  preparatory documents       and         reports   surrounding the    major      Pan-African conferences       on reparations            held        in Nigeria,               Lagos      in             1990       and         Abuja      in 1993  (Bonacci, 2021).    It             is also         used as   a              metaphor               for           the          Pan-African impulse:            Global      Africa      encompasses         a dimension              of             struggle, embodied in           the          social       practices and         movements, political             projects, relationships and  cultures  that         make       up Pan-
Africanism's           history.    This struggle          dimension              could       also         be            described               as            radical    and non-consensual.    It             is             significant              because  it

summons                the topic of             the          interaction             between Africa      and         the          world      and, more specifically,             the          radical    political   projects  originating from    the          relations between Africans  and         Afro-descendants. 
It              should    be            noted      here        that         the          militant   aspect     of             these relations  -  identified              as "Pan-Africanism",  but          also         as "black internationalism",  "the         black       intellectual             tradition", or           "the         black radical    tradition",                depending             on            the          period and             contributors           in             question - has mainly    been       documented in      English   and         not          in             French.   The         historical                and symbolic reasons   behind    this          deserve  to             be            discussed               in detail  by            specialists               in             these linguistic areas,      following Catherine               Coquery-Vidrovitch               (1999).   Notable   gaps        and discrepancies have marred   the          quantity and         quality    of             the knowledge       produced               and         disseminated         on            Pan-Africanism              in             the          Francophone         academic                world,     due         to             scholarly traditions               that have        evolved   differently;             to             French    institutional reticence          towards  the          emergence             of             this field;       a              weak       link between         the          intellectual             work       of             the          militant   Francophone elite and the          deployment           of             activist    social       and         cultural   movements;           besides   a              reluctance              to talk          about      the racial question.2 The       point       here        is certainly             neither   to             discredit scientific production in             French, nor            to             compare research carried    out          in             French    or            in             English   in a simplistic                manner.  Instead,  it              emphasizes            the          extent to which      Pan-Africanism      has          had difficulty establishing           itself in   French    academia.               Moreover,               well-known French               intellectuals, specialists               of             African    history,    may discourage     legitimate               intellectual             curiosity by            claiming  that Pan-Africanism      died        in             the          1960s     with        the          independence of   African    states      or            that         any investigation          into         it              would     be subjective          because  it              could       be            considered             biased, committed,             and         not          impartial3l. There  is,             nonetheless,           a              small       bibliography          in French    on Pan-Africanism,                including short       and         now         outdated texts       (Decraene,             1959);    some classics    (Dewitte, 2011       [1985]); books       on            major      figures    (Tété-Adjalogo,      1995;      Zinsou     and Zoumenou,      2004); studies    on            the          American                and

In addition  to             existing   references,             there       are          recent     yet unpublished    works (Nakao,   2017;      Auque-Pallez,         2021)     and scientific          articles    not          easily      accessible               to             the general   public, which         by            no            means     cover       the          richness  of             the          debate involving    many African    intellectuals           (Mbembe               and         Sarr, 2017).            However, this          literature                hardly     finds       its place       in the      teachings                and         reflections              on            the          history    of             Africa,     even though,          as historian Elikia       M'Bokolo                (2004,    p.             1)            reminds us,            Pan-Africanism      "remains the          most ambitious, all-embracing     ideology  Africa      has          produced               for           itself        since       the          19th         century". 
For           this          reason,    as            the          expression             Global      Africa      is             spreading within   a              French-speaking cultural   and         scientific space,      it is          essential to             recognize                and         return     to             the specific   dimension              it              conveys   and         the          historical                and         conceptual             depth it   holds.      To better     explain   the          project,   the          struggles and movements     that         Global      Africa      encompasses,         I               lean on            two texts written   by            well-known            intellectuals.           These      texts        have been              selected  because  they bear        the          title         Global      Africa and              because  they        locate      precisely this          expression             at             the heart       of             the          Pan-African            movement.             The         first,        by            political scientist   Ali            A. Mazrui,   dates       back        to             1994,      and         the          second was            published               in             2005       by historian Michael   O.             West - both figures             whose     works      have        not          been       sufficiently             discussed in Francophone         research. We           need       then        to             question the          institutionalization                of             this expression             through  the updating          of             UNESCO's               General    History    of             Africa      (GHA)     project, which is             entitled,  precisely, Global      Africa.     The         aim,         obviously, is           certainly not          to             prescribe                a militant   use          of             the expression       Global      Africa      but          to             encourage              incorporating into Global Africa's   future     cultural   and         intellectual             uses        the symbolic          and         political   baggage  the          term conveys.  It             is,             in fact,     a              case         where     knowledge             is             at             stake.      The         point       here is to         place       Global      Africa      in             the          relationship           between Africans and          Afro-descendants, and particularly            in             the          genealogies            of struggle              brought  about      by            this          relationship.           This is             necessary to           grasp      the          militant   origin      of             this          concept   and         to replace               Pan-Africanism within     the          ways       we           view        and         represent Africa    and         Africans' presence in             today's    globalized world. 
                
Ali       A.        Mazrui         and    the     Crusade       for      Reparations 
In             December              1994,      Ali            Mazrui    (1933-2014)        published               the very  first         article,     entitled "Global    Africa:     From       Abolitionists to      Reparationists",     in             African    Studies    Review,    the          journal of               the African    Studies   Association             (ASA),     the          professional organization     of             American                Africanists.             The paper      had been presented              to             the          ASA         the          previous year        as            the          first Bashorun       M. K.             O.             Abiola     Distinguished        Annual    Lecture. This          yearly     conference             within     ASA         was established            thanks to Chief       Abiola's   financial support.  A              successful               Nigerian businessman,         Chief       Abiola was         actively   involved  in the      cause      for           reparations            for           slavery    and         colonialism, and    he            won the          presidential           election   in             Nigeria    in             June 1993 - though            he            actually   never      held        the position,  because the            military   annulled the          elections and         a              coup d'État             took         place       in November              1993.      This         support  was         handed   over by   Ali            Mazrui    to             the          ASA,         with        a view        to             offering an             African    intellectual             the          opportunity           to             participate             in a          major scholarly conference             in             the          USA,        a

It                    is                    a                      complex     issue            with             varying       policy ramifications.                 Two              books          could           contribute to                   the                 discussion:                      a                      reference   work            (Ndiaye,      2008) and                a                      testimony (Soumahoro,                   2020). 3      These          comments were             made            by                  senior         colleagues at                    a round-table                     on                  Pan-Africanism             and                African       Studies       that               I                      organised  during         the                 first Multidisciplinary        Research   Network    Conference                       on                  African       Studies       held              at                    the                 CNRS            in                    2006.

Although the          demand  for           reparations            for           slavery    and colonialism      is             nothing   new,        it              was given       a              fresh       impetus in              the          late          20th        century   in             the          United    States,     Brazil, the Caribbean              and         on            the          African    continent                (Jewsiewicki,          2004;      Martin    and Yaquinto,         2007; Howard-Hassmann,              2008;      Beckles,   2013; Araujo,         2017).    Ali            Mazrui's paper      delves     into         the debates  that         took         place       among    committed African intellectuals           in             the          early       1990s.    In            fact, in             the introduction    and         conclusion              of             the          text,         Mazrui    follows in               the          footsteps of Chief       Abiola,     an            advocate for           a              "crusade for reparations      to             be            paid        to             black people    for           the          hundreds of           years       of             enslavement,         exploitation            and         degradation" (Mazrui, 1994,      p.             1).           Chief       Abiola     had         been       committed              to defending          this          cause      since       the late          1980s,    for           which      he brought             all            his           political,  intellectual             and         financial weight to bear.        He           helped    organize and         finance   the          first         "World Conference                on            Reparations           for Africa      and         Africans  in             the Diaspora"        held        in             Lagos      in             1990,      attended by            the Nigerian political   elite         and         key          figures    from        the          Pan-African            world (Bonacci,      2021).

During    Chief       Abiola's   chairmanship,        GEP         members, including              Ali Mazrui,   launched a              series      of             actions, including  organizing              the          "First       Pan-African            Conference on Reparations"    under     the          aegis       of             the          OAU         and         held        in             Abuja,     Nigeria,   in             April 1993. 
Thus,       as            a              representative       of             the          GEP,         Mazrui    posited   from the outset     a              form        of continuity               between the          abolitionists of      the          past -  who          had         fought     against    the          scourge   of slavery - and        today's    "reparationists",     whom     he            defined   as            a new      moral      and         political   generation advocating              the          idea that the          injustices                of             enslavement          did          not          end         with emancipation, and could       truly        end         only         with        reparations            (Mazrui, 1994,       p.             2).           By describing              the          reparations            movement              as            an offshoot             of             "black     frustration"            and black       nationalism,           and by     placing    its            birth       in             the          Americas and         particularly            in             the United    States,     Mazrui    set           the          scene      for           the          birth       of             Global Africa.          He           explains  the evolving  transformation: "black         people    in             the          diaspora"               demanded             for           reparations            in their        countries,               but          it              is             "Africa's" involvement           in             the          cause that              shifted    these demands towards  a              "world-wide           crusade for             reparations            for           the          African    and         black       world as a         whole"    (Mazrui,  1994,      p.             4).           By            shifting   the          scale        of             his approach          of reparations            from        a              national  issue       to             a              global cause,          Mazrui    makes     it              possible  to conceptualize         Global      Africa. He               defines   this          Global      Africa      as            the          African    continent,               plus the          diaspora resulting from        slavery    and         from        colonialism as        well.        This         concept   is,             of course,    central    to             discussions held    in             the          previous years       and         is             reflected in             the          Abuja Proclamation         (1993),   which      highlights               the          common condition and        cause      of             "the         damaged lives of             contemporary Africans,        from        Harlem   to             Harare,   [and]       the          damaged economies of         the          Black World,     from        Guinea    to             Guyana,   from Somalia         to             Suriname".5            Without  dwelling  here        on            the other arguments   in             Mazrui's text         or            its            apparent limitations,             it              is nevertheless      clear        that the          expression             Global      Africa      does not refer        so            much      to             the          interconnections   between Africa and         the          world,     as            more       particularly            to             the          militant   relations between Africa      and         its diasporas,               old           and         new.        When situated       in             this          well-defined          space,      Global      Africa acquires another  dimension:             one          that         is             geographically       and chronologically               narrower,               but thematically           well-defined and   politically                more       engaged. This         dimension              is             precisely located    in the          relational                space      associated              with        the          creation  of             Pan-Africanism. 
 
Michael        O.        West and    the     History        of        Pan-Africanism 
In             2005,      historian Michael   West        published               an            article     entitled "Global     Africa:     The         Emergence and         Evolution                of             an            Idea"       in             a              special    issue       of             Review,    a              journal    of the          Fernand Braudel  Center    for           the Study                of             Economies,             Historical                Systems, and Civilizations.           This         research center     was         founded  in             1976       by Immanuel         Wallerstein            at Binghamton           University.              Having traditionally              hosted    intellectuals           such        as            Cedric     Robinson, Bernard  Magubane              and         Walter    Rodney,   it              promoted               historical social      science    and         criticized Eurocentrism         in             the          social sciences       (Dufoix   and         Hugot,     2021).    Research on            the          revival of Black World      Studies   quickly    earned    its            place       in             this          special issue,          entitled   The          Black       World      and the           World-System         (Martin,  2005). 
West,       an            African    American                and         renowned              scholar    of             colonial Zimbabwe                and         black internationalism,   questions               the changing          nature    of             African    diaspora studies.   He           argues that             they are          radical,    as            they        challenge                dominant               modes of knowledge             production             on historically             dispossessed populations,    including people    of             African    descent;  and         are also   simultaneously      co-opted,     as            they        are          now         part         of             the academic         establishment        and         can          no            longer align        with        popular  struggles waged     outside   the          academy (West,     2005, p.  85).         From       the          introduction, West        makes     a              sharp distinction   between, on            the          one          hand,      the          African    diasporas' "physical

existence"               as            a              result      of             forced     and         voluntary               migration               from        Africa,     and, on            the          other       hand,      the          "conscious and      systematic              articulation            of             the          idea         of the          African diaspora",  an            idea         he            calls         "Global    Africa".    He           defines   this Global              Africa      as the          idea         that         the          shared    historical                experiences           of             Africans  and         people    of African    descent,  such        as            slavery, colonialism,               racial       oppression             and         their        many       consequences, are          the          basis       of             a              common struggle  for emancipation   and         mutual    liberation               for Africans  at             home      and         abroad    (West,     2005.      p.             86-87). This          definition               of             Global      Africa would     therefore coincide exactly     with        that         of             Pan-Africanism.     This         convergence           is supported          by several    references              strategically           mobilized by          West:       George    Padmore (1956),   a              Trinidadian intellectual involved              at             the          core         of             20th-century          Pan-Africanism; Imanuel     Geiss       (1974 [1968]),  a              German  whose     seminal work         legitimized             the          study       of             the          Pan-African movement; P.

The          rest         of             West's     article     is             an            introductory          historical                summary of           Pan-Africanism, spread    over        four         separate periods. The           first         one,         stretching               from        the          1770s     to             1900, started in                the          Americas with        the          American,               French    and         Haitian revolutions.               Then,      the idea         of             Global      Africa      rested     on two    concepts:                redemption            and         vindication,            and         its proponents were   members                of             a              tiny          black       and         English-speaking male         elite         that wished    to             rehabilitate            Africa's   history    and claim                a              role         in             the          continent's development.6       From       1900       to 1945,  the          second    period     began     with        the          First        Pan-African Conference held        in             London   in             1900,      following which four,             often       antagonistic,           perspectives          unfolded in a              world disrupted    by            two          world      wars:       Pan-African            Congresses, Garveyism,        the          Communist International         and         Negritude.              In 1945, the          anti-colonial           perspective            of             the          Pan-African project and            the          quest      for           political   power     were       clearly     voiced by                the          Pan-African Congress held        in             Manchester.           The         third period,           from        1945       to             1963,      was         characterized by            the          disintegration of    Pan-Africanism      in             the          name      of             African    nationalism and    the emerging                role         of             African    states      as            pivotal players,      thus        affirming the          continent's primacy  over        the          diasporas,               a              primacy  institutionalized    with        the          founding of            the          OAU in             Addis      Ababa     (1963).   In            the          last          period,    from 1963             onwards, there       was         a              major international          political realignment            known    as            Black       Power,     which      was         supported by         several figures,   music,     and         cultures. While      the          first         Pan-African            Congress held        on            the          continent in             Tanzania (1974) drew          attention to             African    states'     grip         on            the          Pan-African movement, twenty    years       later,        African    states      were       delegitimized by    the          failure     of             their        development policies.   When the               seventh  Pan-African            Congress was         being      held        in             Kampala (Uganda),               the initiative came       from        outside   the          state        sector; and             it              tragically coincided                with        the          April 1994       genocide of the      Tutsi       people    in             Rwanda. In            his           article,     West        illustrates how       Global      Africa is             imbricated             in             history    and         he            identifies advocacy                for           reparations            for slavery    and         colonialism,            driven by                activist    movements            rather     than        governments,         as            the 20thcentury            Pan-African            movement's           "central  claim"     (West, 2005,          p.             104).       In            that regard,    West        agrees     with        Mazrui    and         other       specialists               of             Pan-Africanism      (Adi,        2018,      p. 217-220). 
This         summary                of             the          history    of             Pan-Africanism,     which coincides     with        the          idea         of Global      Africa      to             such        an            extent     as to        become   its            synonym,                follows a well-known chronology             and         involves  space-time             markers and          renowned              figures,   with        the          gender,   class and         position nuances   common to             West's     works.     These      nuances  are          not conveyed         precisely in             the above      outline,   though.   As            it              turns out,                the          expression             Global      Africa      suggested               by Michael West         does        not          only         refer        to             the          interconnections   between Africa      and         the          world, nor          solely      to             the          relations between Africa      and         its            old           and         new         diasporas.               More precisely, it             refers      to             the          consciousness        of             a              shared    condition                and         a common struggle, inspired  by            ideals of  sovereignty,            solidarity                and         justice.    Both        articles    by Mazrui               and West,       which      are          among    the          first         to             bear        Global Africa          in             their        title,         sharply   clarify the          militant   origin      of             the expression,      which      stems      from        the          early       1990s     Pan-African movement and         serves     as            a              synonym for           the          history    of             PanAfricanism.      Now,        the          question is: how         has          the          expression Global  Africa      been       recently  adopted  by            the          General    History of               Africa, a              flagship  project    of             UNESCO? 
 
Institutionalizing           Global           Africa 
In             2009,      UNESCO launched the          second    phase      of             the          General History      of             Africa      (GHA),     which consisted                of             developing             pedagogical uses   of             the          knowledge             compiled in             the          eight volumes of             this          collection,               revising  its            contents and         proposing a            new         volume,   volume   IX. This         revision  of             the          contents is organized           around   the          expression             Global      Africa,     described as an            "innovative            concept".7                The         GHA         is             a              monumental          undertaking, launched         in 1964       under     the          impetus  of             the          newly independent              African    states      striving   to             reclaim   and reconstruct their   history.    Numerous              African    historians               were involved        in             this          long-term intellectual             enterprise              under the               supervision            of             an            international          scientific committee. The launch    of             the          GHA         gave        rise          to             documentation      and inventory        work,       valuable campaigns to             compile   oral         and written            archives, as            well         as            a              long         series      of             meetings between the          350         or            so

Intellectual             and         political   commitment,          Pan-Africanism      and         anti-imperialism    were present   in             this project,            in             an            era          marked   as            much      by            Third      Worldism                as by the     liberation               struggles still          underway              on            the          African    continent. From     the          late          1980s on,           there       were       discussions             about drafting       a              sequel     to             GHA,        a              ninth       volume, although the project             was         not          launched (Maurel, 2014,      p.             720).       It             eventually was,      in             2009, following the          African    Union      (AU)        summit in               Sirte        (Libya),   where     member states      pledged  to support this           new         volume,   whose     drafting  was         finally     launched in May    2013       in             Addis      Ababa, Ethiopia. 
In             May         2013,      the          fiftieth      anniversary           of             the          OAU         was         celebrated with     pomp      and circumstance         in             Addis      Ababa,    with a     special    summit   bringing together diplomats               from        across the continent                and         the          world,     and         a              range      of             activities and conferences    organized               as part         of             the          AU's        festivities.               The expert             meeting  to             draft       the          ninth       volume   of GHA         received funding   from        Brazil - a               grand      gesture   on            the          part         of             the great Latin American                country.  With        the          law          10.639/2003, Brazil             had         introduced             the          teaching of African    history    and African            and         Afro-Brazilian        cultures  from        primary  school onwards,    and         its African    diplomacy              was         growing  fast. Indeed,           getting    GHA         and         other       UNESCO flagship  projects to run          smoothly often       depends on            political,  financial and institutional    support  by            states      and intergovernmental organizations - without      its            content   being      subservient            to             political demands. For several    days,       forty        experts   or            so            discussed the         orientations           and         terms      for           the proposed                volume   IX,            under the               leadership              of             GHA's      International         Scientific Committee chairman,               historian Elikia       M'Bokolo.                Without  going       into the   details     of             these       sometimes              very lively       debates,  we           must highlight       the          prominence           of             issues      relating   to             African    diasporas, the challenges              faced       by            Afro-descendants  and         the relations          between Africa      and         its            diasporas.9 
The          session    on            diasporas               was         moderated             by            Sir           Hilary Beckles,       a              historian who specialized             in             slavery    and         the Caribbean       region's   social       and         economic                history,    having served in             many       leadership              positions,                including Principal of            the          Cave        Hill          Campus  in             the University              of             the          West Indies            in             Barbados.               Hilary      Beckles   was         also         the author    of             a plea      for           reparations            for           Caribbean              slavery    and         Native genocide     (2013);  he was         the          coordinator            of             the          Caribbean delegations          throughout            the          World      Conference against Racism,      Racial      Discrimination,      Xenophobia           and         Related Intolerance              organized               by            the United    Nations   in             Durban in               2001;      Vicechairman         of             the          International         Scientific Committee of             UNESCO's               Slave       Route      Project;   and         Chairman of           the          Reparations           Commission           for CARICOM,               the          organization           of             Caribbean states.   As            a              recognized,             committed intellectual, he       opened   discussions             by            calling     for           the          reconceptualization of          African    diasporas' historiography       and         a              critique of              how         African    societies  within     and         outside   the          continent were analyzed. He           called      on            his           colleagues              to             destabilize the       concept   of             diaspora and         to identify   themes   to             represent this        Global      Africa.     During    the          collective                discussion,              many themes were       addressed.             For          instance, the          definition               of             diaspora proposed                by            the          AU and         the          lack         of             action      towards  formalizing             it institutionally     as            a              sixth        region; the dating     of             historical                waves     of             migration               that         have formed           several    strata      of diasporas;              the          rise          of             Afro-Latin organizations      and         demands;               the          risk          of             forced homogenization under         an            umbrella expression             of             Global      Africa;     the          lack         of             teaching on diasporas               in             the          continent's educational        institutions;            and         the          ambition of             considering Africa's   history    without   continental             borders.  All            these       topics were            central    to,            at             times convergent,            at             times       divergent,               but          always    passionate              debates. 
In             anticipation            of             this          volume   IX,            which      has          since       become IX,             X              and         XI, it              is             possible  to             understand            the          significance            of the      expression             Global      Africa introduced             by            UNESCO's               GHA as    the          result      of             intense   negotiations           and         an intellectual and     political   compromise           between perspectives          giving precedence to             Africa's   continental history,    and         others that             consider the          history    of             the          diasporas               as            part         of             the continent's; between            the          conceptual             primacy  given       to             the          race issue               and         a geographical          and         continental             interpretation of    Africanity;              and         between scholarly traditions               in English, French      and         Portuguese.            It             should    be            recalled  that         GHA's history         is             marked   by several    polemics and         compromises, such               as            the          debates  on            the          chapter   written   by Cheikh    Anta Diop               in             volume   II.             Even       though    his           peers      disputed his methodology    and concept   of             "race",     Cheikh    Anta        Diop's chapter       was         eventually              published               because  his argument that       ancient   Egypt      was         of             African    origin      contributed            significantly to       GHA's      project (Schulte  Nordholt,                2021).    The interpretation of             the          term        Global      Africa      publicly  proposed                by GHA10      could       be            described               as            follows:   the          concept makes       it              possible  to             understand "the         history    of             relations between Africans  and         people    of             African    descent   as            an interconnected and continuous             process", in             order      to             break away            from        a              binary     perspective            on            Africa and         its            diasporas as           distinct   and         separate groups.   Furthermore,         the          concept of              Global      Africa aims        to             go            beyond   the          "race       issue" - and, therefore,        the          sometimes-disputed             juxtaposition between Africanity                and         negritude - to      focus       on            "Africa's  multifaceted presence"        taking     particular account   of             the          diasporas in           the          Indian     Ocean,     the          Near        and         Middle    East         and         Asia. This         interpretation        reflects   the          relational                space      between Africa      and         its            diasporas               that Mazrui    identified               as            the matrix              of             Global      Africa.     However, GHA's      concept   of             diasporas deviates  from        Michael   West's,    who         distinguished         the physical            presence of             people    of             African descent   (the         various

West        only         considered             the          latter       in             his           concept   of Global Africa and         located    this          idea         of             diaspora specifically in         the          Atlantic   space,      and         not          equally   in the          many       African diasporas, where     issues      of             integration,            belonging               and         social mobility       are not          akin         to             the          model     of             the          Atlantic   space      and         the          Americas (Zeleza,   2010). 
With        this          new         "innovative            concept", GHA's      ambition was also  to             "better    understand            the aspirations             of             the          new         generations in       Africa      and         its            diasporas               to             contribute to             the African             Renaissance           and         the          construction           of             a              21st         century Pan-Africanism". Is             this          the          militant   and         committed              spirit associated    with        the          historical                Pan-Africanist project?  Or            the stilted               vocabulary             used        for           the          institutional           communication of the          AU and         UNESCO?                Probably both,       as            the          use          of             Global Africa          seems     to             be            the result      of             an            intellectual             and         political compromise            between Africa      and         its            diasporas that         could be summarized           as            follows:   GHA         maintains               the          dimension              of political commitment          and         the          common struggle  that         the expression       Global      Africa      represents             while leaving    behind the             Atlantic   confines  and         the          radical    tradition associated with      it.             Despite   stating    its ambition to             embrace the          great diversity       of             African    diasporas,               GHA         nevertheless          claims     to be based      on            the          political   projects  that         have        emerged from the relationship           between Africa      and         the Atlantic   diaspora: African   Renaissance           and         Pan-Africanism.     This         is             the          fulcrum on             which      GHA seems     to             be            based:     the          desire     to             go beyond              the          Atlantic   space      while       simultaneously extending the        Pan-African            project    associated              with        it.             The         process   of institutionalizing               Global Africa,     an            expression             that         originated              in             committed              Pan-African            circles     and         the concept around     which      GHA's      momentous            project    revolves, is             not free  of             tensions  and         is             still ongoing.  Nevertheless,         it              promises a             central    location   to             the          Pan-African            project    in             the ways       we           think       and         represent               the          presence of             Africa      and Africans           in             our globalized               world.

While      the          expression             Global      Africa      has          recently  been       used to    represent               the          interactions and         interconnections   between Africa      and         the          world,     it              is             essential to             remember              that this expression      originated              in             Pan-Africanist        circles     and         in             radical political      projects  born        out of             the          historical                relations between Africans  and         Afro-descendants. In            an            attempt  to clarify the project,   the          struggles and         mobilizations         that         the expression       Global      Africa      encompasses,         I               have selected  and presented       two          texts        published               by            Ali            Mazrui    and         Michael West,         the          first ones        to             include   the          term        in             their        titles. Mazrui's       1994       article     places     Global      Africa      at the          heart       of             the relationship     between Africa      and         the          diaspora by            focusing on            the          cause of             reparations            for           slavery    and         colonialism. A Global             Africa      appeared               on            the international          scene      thanks to committed              African    figures    at             the          highest   state        level, who               joined the          claims     for           reparations            made      by            diaspora representatives.    The         second    article,     dating     from 2005,      juxtaposed Global  Africa      with        Pan-Africanism's   political   and social               history    and         thus        located    Global Africa      in             the          consciousness that                a              shared    experience             of             oppression             was         the basis       for           a              common struggle  for           emancipation.        These      two precursory     uses        of             the expression             Global      Africa      illustrate its            specific,   militant   and         politically                committed              dimension, which      should    not          be            obscured by            the          reproduction         and great                variability               of             its contemporary        cultural   and         intellectual uses.    The         expression             Global      Africa      has          also         been institutionalized through     intellectual             and         political   processes that       have        placed     the          expression             at the          core         of             the          update of                UNESCO's               General    History    of             Africa,     precisely entitled Global Africa.     By            providing               a              strong     institutional           anchor to                a              concept   that         emerged from PanAfrican             movements, the     scholars  involved  in             this          colossal   project    extended the Pan-African     project    and placed     it              once        again       at             the          heart of   their        ways       of             thinking  and         representing          the presence of             Africa      and         Africans  in             our          globalized               world. 
In             the          new         contemporary        uses        of             the          expression             Global Africa,          which      focus       on the          interactions            between Africa      and the   world      and         apply      to             all            kinds       of             fields,      the same       specific symbolic   and         political   baggage  seems     to             disappear.              It             is indeed uncertain whether the          structuring             tropes     of             Pan-Africanism      and         their        radical    and         non-consensual dimension already have        their        place       in             this          wealth    of             academic publications.         However, the          study of             reparations            advocacy, the         critical     history    of             struggles and         solidarity,                and         the idea  of global      Africanity               could       play         their        full          part         in             the representations              of             Africa's   and Africans' presence in             the world.               Knowledge             on            Pan-Africanism      could       contribute more    directly   to building  academic                knowledge             on            Africa      in French,               by            giving      their        rightful   place       to controversial          personalities, ambiguous     political   projects,  manifold instrumentalization, and      divergent               interpretations; as            well         as            to the      great       aspirations,            bitter      failures   and         fantastic  victories carried    by            the many       voices      that         have        emerged from        Global Africa.          Therefore,              as            its            name      promises, this          new         journal could         become   a              space      wherein  to             discuss,   nurture,  and disseminate    accurate and documented          knowledge             on            the history             of             Pan-Africanism      and         its            radical    political   and cultural projects.
