<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>It is said that when the journalist and reporter for the <i>Christian
Science Monitor</i> Arthur Unger challenged and questioned Mazrui on some of
the issues raised in his televised series entitled <i>The Africans: A Triple
Heritage</i> (1986), he smiled and responded this way: ‘Good, [...]. Many
people disagree with me. My life is one long debate’ (Family Obituary of Ali
Mazrui 2014). The logical question is how do we remember Professor Ali A Mazrui
who died on Sunday 12 October 2014 and who understood his life to be ‘one long
debate’?  More importantly how do we reflect fairly on Mazrui’s academic and
intellectual life without falling into the traps of what the South Sudanese
scholar Dustan M. Wai (1984) coined as <i>Mazruiphilia</i> (hagiographical
pro-Mazruism) and <i>Mazruiphobia</i> (aggressive anti-Mazruism)?  </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>How do we pay tribute to such an ‘encyclopedic’ academic
and an ‘intellectual pluralist’ whose scholarly contributions not only
transcended traditional academic disciplinary boundaries but also broke
bondages of academic ‘tribalism,’ making him at once a leading political
scientist, historian, international relations specialist, global cultural
studies scholar as well as a postcolonial theorist? How do we make sense of
such a public intellectual who attracted both admiration and hatred in equal
measure? These important questions speak to the pertinent issue of how to
approach the expansive work of Mazrui. The best way is to take one of the
debates in Mazrui’s expansive work that of the invention of Africa, meaning of
Africanity, and the concomitant complex question of the African condition.  </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>On the <i>Mazruiphilia</i> one finds celebratory works,
praises and rankings of Mazrui as global scholar and opinion-maker. For
instance the journal <i>Foreign Affairs </i>(2005)<i> </i>identified<i> </i>Mazrui
as ‘One of the top 100 public intellectuals in the world’ while David Horowitz
(2006) included Mazrui in the list of ‘101 Most Dangerous Academics in
America.’ To Edward Said (1994: 239) ‘it is no longer possible to ignore the
work of [...] Ali Marui in even a cursory survey of African history, politics
and philosophy’ because he is ‘a first class academic authority.’ To the former
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan (2000), Mazrui was ‘Africa’s gift
to the world.’ Philip Darby (1997: 18) praised Mazrui as a ‘resistance
theorist’ who has consistently stood ‘on the side of rights and justice rather
than order and stability.’ Colin Leys had all the praises for Mazrui’s
contribution: </p>

a master wordmonger and certainly does not belong to that class of men who
lament that words fail them [...]. It is because of his conjurer’s ability to
negotiate between the realm of serious issues and the province of provocative
words and concepts, that divide his readers between those who take him
seriously, and those who take him lightly</span> (Nyang 1981: 36).     </p>

‘masterly control of English sometimes influences him to evoke certain words
that generate controversy. Such situations tend to shift the discussion away
from the noble idea to the political correctness of the word.’ Indeed his use
of the word ‘re-colonization’ as a remedy to what became known as African
failed states led to a serious challenge to his ideas by Archie Mafeje (1995)
who posed the question: ‘If Ali Mazrui is a leading African scholar, who is he
leading and where to?’ To Mafeje (1995: 17), Mazrui had come full circle by
1994 to be of service to British and American imperialists to the extent of
positing recolonization as a solution for Africa.  In response Mazrui (1995:
18) explained that he has been concerned about ‘Africa’s self pacification for
about thirty years’ which was captured by his use of the concept of <i>Pax
Africana</i>. He elaborated that his use of the word ‘self-colonization’ was
meant to capture his long-standing concern about ‘how can Africa develop a
capacity for effective inter-African control, inter-African pacification, and
collective self-discipline’ (Mazrui 1995: 20). Mazrui further argued in his
defence that: </p>

European colonialism and the equivalent of Pax Britannica. But I fear that if

malevolent colonial force by others </span>(Mazrui 1995: 20). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>To Mazrui (1995: 20) such an event as the unification of
Tanzania and Zanzibar in 1964, was a typical example of ‘inter-African
colonization.’ It would seem Mazrui’s use of the term </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>‘recolonization’ did not go well with African scholars who
still had deep memories of European colonization. But some of Mazrui’s admirers
have credited him for writing and telling the history of Africa as it is. He
has not been shy to take on revered African leaders like Kwame Nkrumah and
Julius Nyerere to task for pursuing wrong politics and adopting wrong economic
frameworks.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>However, what is emerging is that <i>Mazruiphilia</i> is
countered by a strong <i>Mazruiphobia</i> that has produced various negative
depictions of Mazrui. James N. Karioki (1974) questioned Mazrui’s commitment to
the African cause of freedom and aspirations as well as the relevance of his
scholarly interventions as far back as 1974. In the 1960s and 1970s, commitment
and relevance was defined as pursuing scholarship and intellectualism that was
contributing to the advancement of the African processes of liberation from colonialism
and neo-colonialism as well as pushing for a dignified place for Africa in
global power structures (Karioki 1974: 55).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>During the course of anti-colonial struggles and even after
attainment of political independence, adoption of the Marxist ideas and
materialist understanding of society became the major badge of serious
commitment to the African cause of liberation and development. But Mazrui
(1974: 70) broke rank and condemned Marxism as a threat to African intellectual
authenticity, criticising African Marxists of suffering from intellectual
dependency and castigating the adoption of Marxism by African scholars as amounting
to ‘dual westernization.’ Committed scholarship and intellectualism today is
measured in terms of advancement of gender equality, de-imperialization of what
Mazrui termed ‘global apartheid,’ democratization and human rights, economic
development, social justice, and environmental responsibility among other
progressive agendas. To argue that Mazrui has not been committed to the
advancement of these issues is to be blinded and close-minded by <i>Mazruiphobia</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>A charge sheet cascading from the camp of <i>Mazruiphobia</i>
is overly long. Mazrui is depicted as ‘an aloof polemicist who is quick to
announce and condemn the failures of the continent without suggesting
thought-out alternatives.’ He is accused of having been sympathetic to such
hated African leaders as Moise Tshombe of Congo who instigated secession of
Katanga and Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda of Malawi who during the course of
decolonial struggles broke rank with others and established links with imperial
and colonial white regimes of southern Africa. This position of Mazrui was
interpreted by some African scholars as tantamount to deliberate hurting of
African nationalist emotions. For instance, Mazrui in <i>Towards Pax Africana:
A Study of Ideology and Ambition</i> (1967) wrote that ‘the use of foreigners
to commit some of the atrocities (in the Congo) might cynically but truly be a
positive contribution to the realization of future peace.’ This might be
considered to be Mazrui’s germinal thoughts that finally led him to posit the
highly controversial ‘recolonization thesis’ in 1994. His ‘re-colonization’
thesis was introduced at a time when the African continent was searching for
what became known as ‘African solutions to African problems.’  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Mazrui’s criticism of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere of Tanzania of
contributing to the failure of the East African federation and turning the
University of Dar-es-Salaam into a ‘uniideological institution’ and Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana of being a ‘Leninist’ on the African continent and a ‘Tsar’ in
Ghana, did not go down well with other African scholars (Mazrui, 1965; Mazrui
1966; Mazrui 1967; Karioki 1974). While Mazrui had a point on the issue of
turning a university into a centre of pursuit of a singular ideology of African
socialism, his tendency of breaking rank from other African scholars who were
sympathetic to Nkrumah and Nyerere’s efforts in pushing for pan-African unity
and socialism, earned him the label of an ‘imperialist agent’ and of
approaching African issues from a colonial mindset. In a recent obituary, the
Kenyan political scientist Peter Anyang Nyong’o and a former student of Mazrui
at Makerere University flashed back to the 1960s when Mazrui published two
controversial essays on Ghana and Tanzania that provoked fierce debates. This
is how he put it: </p>

112%'>It was in the columns of Transition that Mazrui’s two controversial
essays on Ghana and Tanzania were first fiercely debated: ‘Tanzaphilia’ and
‘Nkrumah the Leninist Czar.’ In the latter essay Mazrui discussed the
‘monarchical tendencies in African politics’ pointing out that, notwithstanding
his socialist radicalism (like Lenin), his style of leadership (with chiefly
symbols and a search for legitimacy in a royalist past) Nkrumah was much more
like a Russian Tsar than a Marxist radical. For-pan-Africanists like us who
believed in Nkrumah’s almost saintly leadership of the African revolution, we
did not take kindly to Mazrui’s exercise in comparative political theory. Some
even branded Mazrui as ‘an imperialist agent’ </span></p>

as ‘Africanization of capitalism’ to produce a multi-racial bourgeois class and
was opposed to the popular adoption of socialism. His argument was that
postcolonial states’ first task was to accelerate economic growth before
attempting ‘to achieve equality in poverty’ (Mazrui 1967c: 46; Mazrui 1969). 
His thesis seems to be that African societies must aim for economic development
first before adopting socialism. To Mazrui the genius of capitalism was in
production and that of socialism was in distribution. While there is a lot of
sense in some of the issues that Mazrui raised, a charge sheet from other
African scholars is given by Karioki: </p>

Ali Mazrui into three broad categories. First, he is an advocate of the status
quo wholly indifferent to the search for beneficial change in the African
society, but deeply involved in fabricating intellectual apologia for the
conservatives and the reactionaries. Second, he is self-seeking ‘scholar’ who
will neither hesitate to abandon intellectual honesty and integrity in pursuit
of personal motives, nor be haunted by a troubled conscience on account of
attacking constructive African leaders unfairly and unjustly. Finally, Mazrui’s
works display a remarkable absence of concern for the African masses. When he
is not busy entertaining his erudite audience in the West with academic puzzles,
or defending elitism in Africa, or attacking imaginative African leadership, he
is content to remain a semi-detached, backward-looking polemicist in the
deliberations of colonial liberation</span> (Karioki 1974: 62-63). </p>

commitment to Africa, his 1986 television series entitled <i>The Africans: A

Kenya, the series was banned for many years for being too anti-African (Family
Obituary of Ali Mazrui 2014). The Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka was also
critical of Mazrui’s television series, caricaturing the concept of ‘triple
heritage’ as nothing but a ‘triple tropes of trickery’ charging that African
indigenous traditions were denigrated while the positive role of Islamic and
Christian traditions were extolled and exaggerated (Soyinka 1991). Soyinka even
questioned Mazrui’s very ‘Africanness’ (‘<i>The Africans</i> was not a series
made by a black African’) (Soyinka 1991: 180). This personal attack provoked
Mazrui to respond by saying:  </p>

acculturated Arab.’ This did not go well with Mazrui who considered himself an
African. While Mazrui criticised Soyinka for being rude and deceptive, the
‘Mazrui-Soyinka Debate’ raised the sensitive and inconclusive questions of who
is an ‘authentic’ African and how ‘Africanity’ is defined. This is a theme that
Mazrui delved deeper into from the time of his first publication ‘‘On the
Concept ‘We Are All Africans’’’ (1963) and was further explored in his
televised series <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i> (1986).  </p>

that comes out is that often human subjectivity/identity is born out of being
named by others in particular ways: ‘We are what we are because of what we (are
made to) think we are’ (Adem 2014: 138). But he resisted Soyinka’s attempts to
name him as ‘an acculturated Arab.’ African subjectivity/identity in general
has undergone invention and representation cascading from colonial and cultural
encounters. Africans have been engaged in a long struggle involving rejecting
and resting some demeaning ‘namings’ and ‘representations’ while at the same
time seeking for the elusive sovereign subjectivity.     </p>

and depth of his work. Such critics as Archie Mafeje (1998) and Ogundipe-Leslie

of flowery language, rich metaphors and specious correlations at the expense of
methodological due diligence. His use of semi-autobiographical methodology of
delivery of his work provoked his critics to accuse him of being obsessed with
self-promotion, egoism and self-flattery (Adem 2014: 140). Seifudein Adem
(2014: 140) defined Mazrui’s approach to writing that included his life stories
and academic trajectories as ‘transactional’ methodology.  Mazrui defended his
approach in 1973 in this way: ‘Because political consciousness is so
intricately bound up with growth of a person’s general awareness, political
scientists should perhaps devote more time to using their own lives as data for
the study of the growth of political consciousness’ (Mazrui 1973: 101).  </p>

‘triple heritage’ is ‘his most innovative, and possibly, most enduring
contribution to scholarship.’  This is mainly because it dealt directly with
the topical issue of African identity, Africanity and their inventions. Are the
roots and identities of African people nested in three ‘heritages’: African,
Islamic, and Western? Heritage is something people are proud of and wish to
hold on to it. People are generally nostalgic about their heritage. Are Africans
really proud of Islamic and Western heritage, particularly its linkages with
the slave trade, imperialism, violent colonial conquest, colonialism, and
apartheid? Perhaps the problem is with the use of the word ‘heritage’ by
Mazrui.  </p>

intellectual trajectory is a shift from his earlier focus on political
philosophy and political sociology in the 1960s and 1970s to the cultural
issues. But he never abandoned his interest in identity politics and political
thought. Broadly speaking, one can argue that the themes of invention of
Africa, definition of Africanity and articulation of the complex ‘African
condition’ were framed by two broad strands namely the post-Enlightenment
Eurocentric view and the decolonial perspective which is itself constituted by
a diverse family of ideological and intellectual streams.  </p>

unremarked. Unlike the Americas or Australasia, for instance, no one actually
claims to have ‘discovered’ Africa. Neither the continent as an entity nor
indeed any of her later offspring—the modern states— celebrates the equivalent
of America’s Columbus Day. This gives it a self-constitutive identity, an
unstated autochthony that is denied other continents and subcontinents. The
narrative history of encounters with Africa does not dispute with others or
revise itself over the ‘discovery’ of Africa. Even her name is not attached to
any enterprising nation, power, or individual adventurer. Africa appears to
have been ‘known about,’ speculated over, explored both in actuality and
fantasy, even mapped—Greeks, Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, etc., took turns—but no
narrative has come down to us that actually lays personal or racial claim to
the discovery of the continent. Ancient ruins, the source of a river, mountain
peaks, exotic kingdom, and sunken pyramids, yes, but not the continent
itself—as in the case of the Americas. Hundreds have ventured into, explored,
and extensively theorized over the continent, but no one has actually claimed
to have discovered her </span>(Soyinka 2012: 27). </p>

invention of Africa and shaping notions of Africanity.   </p>

profound effects on the development and fossilization Africanity as an
identity. We need to understand the logic of imperial reason and the operations
of the paradigm of difference. It is in this Eurocentric discourse that the
racial paradigm of difference and the politics of alterity are rooted. This is
why Mudimbe (2013:11) wrote that ‘As a conceptuality, Africa has been presumed
a transparent concept in most politics of alterity and by almost everyone as a
key to the assurance of a difference.’ </p>

Africa and Africanity. He was not ‘opening a closed file’ as Edward Said (1994:
34) wanted us to believe. The file had remained open since the time of colonial
encounters and the decolonization process failed to close it. Decolonization
and de-racialization projects of the 20<sup>th</sup> century only partially
closed the chapter. Mazrui therefore built his discourse on ‘triple heritage’
on an existing African archive represented by such thinkers as William Wilmot
Blyden in his <i>Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race</i> (1967) and Kwame
Nkrumah in his <i>Consciencism: Philosophy and the Ideology for Decolonization</i>

decolonial consciousness building on the concrete African historical and

of Africa in 1963. In his article ‘‘On the Concept of ‘We Are All Africans,’’
Mazrui began to demonstrate how Africanity as an identity was a complex product
of double invention by colonial imperatives and African imperatives. The
colonial imperatives included map-making, partitioning of Africa, domination,
and promotion of a singular idea of an African people who were collectively
thought of as inferior, backward and primitive beings, which inadvertently
provoked what </p>

invention of Africa using such means as the First All-Africa People’s
Conference held in Accra in December 1958 to ‘re-member’ Africa after

enlightening. His entry point was to explore two schools of African history
namely the ‘epic school’ and the ‘episodic school’ as an ideal way of
introducing the debates on the impact of colonialism in the invention of Africa
and making of Africanity. The ‘epic school’ emphasises the revolutionary if not
the civilizational transformation that was introduced on Africa by colonial
encounters and colonialism. The school highlights the violent incorporation of
Africa into the world economy through ‘the slave trade, which dragged African
labour itself into the emerging international capitalist system’ (Mazrui 1986:

world of international law, which is again heavily Eurocentric in origin’

deliberate ‘dis-Africanization’ and ‘Westernization’ of Africa to the extent
that: ‘What Africa knows about itself, what different parts of Africa know
about each other, have been profoundly influenced by the West’ (Mazrui 1986:

school of history’ became informed by nationalist historiography that developed
in Ibadan and Dar-es-salaam. It was actually the historian J. F. Ade Ajayi of
the University of Ibadan who depicted colonialism as an ‘episode’ in African
history. Nationalist historiography was ranged against imperial historiography
that had denied the existence of African history prior to the colonial
encounters (Temu and Swai 1981; Lovejoy 1986; Zeleza 1997). The important point
of the ‘episodic school’ is that European impact on Africa was not profound; it
was brief, shallow, transitional, and not long-lasting. Capitalism as an
economic system was shallow. Consequently, there was continuity of African
history from pre-colonial period to the postcolonial period with colonialism
having been a brief disruption to continuity. The implication of this
interpretation of the impact of colonialism is that that Africans continued to
make their own history and to invent themselves as a people with agency. In the
face of these two schools, Mazrui’s conclusion was:  </p>

haunted by ‘a war of cultures’ but whether this cultural crisis is responsible
for ‘inefficiency, mismanagement, corruption and decay of the infrastructure’
is debatable (Mazrui 1986: 12). Is postcolonial Africa suffering from ‘failure
of transplanted organs of the state and the economy’?  Is the decay of
infrastructure in postcolonial Africa to be celebrated as a form of African
resistance to imposed Western civilization? Mazrui’s take is contained in this

and prefer a postcolonial Africa that is freed from the ancestral constraints
in his influential book entitled <i>In My Father’s House: Africa in the
Philosophy of Culture</i> (1992). Appiah challenged even the concept of
Africanity as fictitious and a racist invention of pan-Africanists and
nationalists. </p>

African conceptions’ and of ‘an African worldview’ (Appiah 1992: xxvii). But as
demonstrated by Mazrui and others, African identity is a product of colonial
encounters, colonization, and resistance. It is not a primordial phenomenon. At
the centre of Africanity is what Mazrui (1980) described as the African
condition which is an encapsulation of African postcolonial predicaments.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>There is no doubt that present day Africanity was indeed
shaped by a complex and paradoxical combination of indigenous African cultures
as well as imposed Islamic and Western cultures. To Mazrui, postcolonial
predicaments and instabilities haunting postcolonial Africa are a ‘symptom of
cultures at war’ with Africans fighting ‘to avert the demise of Africanity’
(Mazrui 1986: 21). At the centre of these ‘culture wars’  ‘is Africa’s triple
heritage of indigenous, Islamic and Western forces—fusing and recoiling, at once
competitive and complimentary’ (Mazrui 1986: 21).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Therefore redemption of Africa according to Mazrui (1986:
295) lies in two options: ‘the imperative of looking inwards towards Africa’s
ancestors’ and ‘the imperative of looking outward towards the wider world.’
Indigenous African culture is the basis of the inward looking option but ‘is
not identical with looking inwards at yesterday’s Africa’ but must gesture
towards ‘a special transition from the tribe to the human race, from the
village to the world’ (Mazrui 1986: 295).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>But this option needs to take into account what Mazrui
distilled as the ‘six paradoxes’ of the postcolonial African condition. The
first is the ‘paradox of habitation’ which speaks to how a continent that has
been identified as the ‘cradle of mankind’ is at the same time the least
hospitable today. The second is the ‘paradox of humiliation’ which highlights
how Africa is a product of a humiliating history of enslavement, colonization
and racial discrimination. The third is the ‘paradox of acculturation’ cascading
from imposition of foreign cultural, political, economic and social  forms that
disturbed and reproduce Africanity as a complex nest of unstable, contested,
and conflicting set of identities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The fourth is the ‘paradox of fragmentation’ rooted in
capitalist economic exploitation that reproduced Africa as a site of
underdevelopment, maldistribution and economic disarticulation. The fifth is
the ‘paradox of retardation’ manifesting itself in the form of Africa’s failure
to act as a unit due to internal weaknesses cascading from national, ethnic,
ideological and religious cleavages. The last is the ‘paradox of location’ that
speaks to how a continent which is centrally located but is at the same time
the most marginal in global power politics (Mazrui 1980). How does Africa
extricate itself from these paralyzing paradoxes? Mazrui does not provide a way
out. But his diagnosis is illuminating nonetheless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The postcolonial predicaments are compounded by a
leadership crisis. To Mazrui postcolonial Africa has produced four types of
leadership: elder tradition whose symbol was Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya; warrior
leadership represented by Idi Amin of Uganda; sage tradition typified by Julius
Nyerere of Tanzania; and monarchical tradition that was portrayed by Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana. These types of leadership produced five styles of leadership:
intimidatory; patriarchal, reconciliatory; bureaucratic, and mobilization leader
(Mazrui and Mutunga 2003).  It would seem these types and styles of leadership
had the following outcome: </p>

not outlawed opposition parties,’ as a country that has not ‘experienced a
military coup,’ and a country that has not ‘permitted the head of state to
govern’ as a dictator, in his 2011 lecture delivered at the University of Free
State, is facing its own challenges such as deepening inequalities, corruption

to promote intellectual close-mindedness. Both processes of calling Mazrui
‘names’ (<i>a la</i> <i>Mazruiphobia</i>) and piling ‘praises’ (<i>a la</i> <i>Mazruiphilia</i>)
is not too helpful, scholarly speaking. What is needed is an approach to
Mazrui’s academic and intellectual work which avoids a totalizing perspective,
that is, one that attempts to give a total picture of Mazrui’s academic and
intellectual identity and his diverse academic and intellectual production. A
binary-oriented approach involving choosing sides between <i>Mazruiphilia</i>
and <i>Mazruiphobia</i> must be avoided as it is not enlightening on the
impressive intellectual and academic life of Mazrui. In any case, the academy
is not expected to be a domain of intellectual and academic consensus. The
academy is ideally expected to be a boiling site of diverse ideas. Mazrui was
one academic who lived the life of an academic and intellectual that produced diverse
ideas and took diverse positions and was basically not pro-establishments.   </p>

try and box and tag him as a scholar. He wrote more than 35 books, numerous
book chapters, hundreds of scholarly articles, as well as many magazine and
newspaper commentaries. Mazrui’s active academic and intellectual life spans
over 50 years. What is noticeable in Mazrui’s academic and intellectual
interventions is iconoclasm (challenging cherished ideas) and
independent-mindedness (maverick). Both are hallmarks of academia and Mazrui
cannot be criticised for it. He became a full professor at the age of 34,
having risen from lecturer, skipping two ranks of senior lecturer and associate
professor.  </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>Mazrui left behind a ‘supermarket of ideas’ or a
‘Mega-Mall’ on various topical subjects and pertinent themes. The concept of
supermarket of ideas speaks to both the quantity and quality of Mazrui’s
contributions. As noted by Anthony Clayton (1979: 122) in his review of
Mazrui’s <i>The Warrior Tradition in Modern Africa</i> (1977): ‘Like any good
supermarket, the quality of the goods vary; the best are very stimulating
indeed.’  While Clayton was writing specifically about an edited volume with
various chapters by different authors, the concept of a supermarket is also
relevant to the expansive and diverse work of Mazrui that warrants a selective
approach. Mazrui’s contribution to the animated debates on invention of Africa,
Africanity and African condition (postcolonial African predicaments) is rich
enough to enable a critical reflection on his scholarly legacy. Identity,
culture and power practices occupied Mazrui’s mind.   </p>

rich and diverse archive that address various aspects of the idea of Africa,
Africanity and the African condition. While some would say that Mazrui used
controversy as his pathway to academic and intellectual greatness, there is no
doubt that he also played a leading role in pan-African initiatives such as
UNESCO African History Project and he was part of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) appointed Eminent Persons Group tasked to push for reparations and
restorative justice campaign in the 1980s. What also emerges poignantly is that
Mazrui was an independent scholar that did not easily fall into either Marxist,
Gramscian or Foucaldian descriptions. He managed to create a ‘Mazruism’’   </p>

freedom by South Africa in the 1990s; that some Islamic countries will possess
nuclear weapons; the rise of China to a world power and that Islam would
replace communism as ‘the West’s perceived adversary’ (Adem 2014c). There is no

</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The theme of invention of Africa and postcolonial African
predicaments is broadly about contested and complex discourses of the idea of
Africa, the essence and meaning of Africanity (African identity) and the key
contours of the ‘African condition.’ Mazrui was an active contributor to these
complex issues despite the fact that towards the end of his academic and
intellectual career, he increasingly focused on the equally topical and
important theme of Islamophobia. He increasingly became identified as ‘a spokesperson
for Islam in the West’ (Adem 2014a: 132). Mazrui justified this shift by
arguing that in contemporary history ‘negro-phobia’ has de-escalated while
‘Islamo-phobia’ has escalated to the extent that the colour line has been
superseded by the culture line (Adem 2014a: 132; see also Mazrui 1990, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>1997). Part of Marui’s evidence for the sign of
de-escalation of the colour line was the election of Barack Obama as the first
African American President of the United States (Adem </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>2014a: 132). But one remains unconvinced on whether
‘negro-phobia’ has indeed deescalated enough to the extent of warranting a
shift to Islamophobia or whether the colour line and the culture line are not
entangled paradoxically. As in life, Mazrui’s in death will continue to exert
influence on the way we think, and many of his concerns, as in Africanity and
the ‘African condition’ will continue to be subjects of debates.    </p>
