<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> In our arduous times, what are the
changing roles of intellectuals? What are their responsibilities to society? To
examine these issues in the African context, let us peer into the world of Ali
Mazrui, one of the continent’s bestknown scholars. He has had great influence
on the public, political authorities, and generations of youth to whom
civilizational values are transmitted. This process is how societies perpetuate
themselves and adapt to changing conditions. At issue are social reproduction
and the analytical foundations of democratic deliberations, or, conversely,
repressive tendencies. These legacies shape the common heritage of a society
and safeguard the expressive freedom of its institutions. The stakes in the
nexus of knowledge and power are therefore quite high, as evident in the case
of Mazrui’s lifelong work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> The approach in this article is intellectual ethnography.
It examines one scholar’s transcripts, his creativity, his use of analogy, and
the power of storytelling. The discussion that follows is meant to offer a
prism, albeit a partial one, for viewing African studies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> In probing Mazrui’s conceptual makeup, let us not confuse
substance and style. I salute his substance, applaud his panache, and will
issue critical challenges. I will proceed with respect and admiration, but know
that Mazrui would give me a failing mark if I were to shirk my academic
responsibility and try to worm out of scholarly debate, which, after all, is
our stock-in-trade, our métier. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> The exchange here is staged as a series of imaginary
interlocutions with four theorists who have addressed the roles of
intellectuals in society: Antonio Gramsci, Max Weber, Edward Said, and Thandika
Mkandawire. This platform will give Mazrui, an artisan skilled in repartee, an
opportunity to ply his craft. He thrives on criticism; it elicits the best in
him as he envisages a better intellectual community. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> One caveat: if I have overlooked a crucial reading for
this assignment, I plead guilty on the ground that Mazrui’s output is massive;
the sheer quantity would practically fill a library. And his creative energies
are exceptional. Having read or reread several Mazrui scripts, I have sought to
do my homework, and hope that the professor will tread gingerly on any errors
of omission, though not commission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> For the sake of full disclosure, I should reveal that Ali
and I first met in 1967 when I enrolled in the M.A. program in African Studies
at Makerere University: at the time, a part of the University of East Africa, a
regional institution with campuses in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. Then, as
now, he boosted many young academics. I should know. As head of the Department
of Political Science and Public Administration, and dean of the Faculty of
Social Sciences, Ali created the position of special tutor, enabling me to
return to Uganda in 1970. I have never recovered from this good fortune. Ever
since our Makerere days, Ali has been an esteemed colleague, and we have
enjoyed many fruitful exchanges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.8pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> While I have benefited from Ali’s bigheartedness, he would
not want those good deeds to impinge on an honest dialogue. Ali’s generous
spirit certainly did not prevent him from exercising his administrative duties
at Makerere, as when he understandably grew cross with me. Rightly, Ali
reproached me for my absences from Kampala on account of straying to Karamojo
in the northern reaches of Uganda, archaeological digs at the ancient kingdom
of Bunyoro-Kitara, Rwandan refugee camps in the south, and neighboring
countries. Noting my peripatetic ways, he remarked that I must have Somali
genes. Likened to a pastoralist, I perhaps should have been quick on my feet
and tossed a Mazrui-like turn of phrase back at him: if I am given to  <i>geographical</i>
wanderlust, you, Ali, are prone to  <i>intellectual</i> wanderlust. This trait
is the result of his inquiring mind that dares dart from one theme to another
without hesitating to hurl spears of argumentation at others on a journey of
knowledge generation. Truly, Mazrui’s vocation is intellectual curiosity fueled
by strong convictions. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The Intellectual Calling </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> By definition, intellectuals are
fascinated with ideas. Our calling is the passion to battle over the production
of new knowledge. That said, there are myriad valuable reflections on the lot
of the intelligentsia. Although some formulations transcend context, world
regions have conceived their own positions on this issue. Whereas the genesis
of the knowledge structure in the West differs from that in Africa, there is no
need to proceed  <i>de novo</i> . We can draw on eminent analysts as markers
for gauging the roles of intellectuals in respect to social transformation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> To structure the ensuing discussion, it is well to
highlight telling points made by Gramsci, Weber, Said, and Mkandawire. <sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:105%'> 1 </span></sup> Before tracing the
ideas of these four authors, however, a few words are needed about why I
selected them as touchstones for weighing Mazrui’s work. Of necessity a long
list of writers would be impossible to fit into this article. But the heuristic
of imagined dialogues with this particular set of theorists evokes insights
about knowledge production larger than engagement with sundry individuals’
contributions. This assemblage is derived from times of social disruption in
the thinkers’ respective contexts: for Gramsci, the stormy period of Italian
fascism; for Weber, societal conflicts linked to Germany’s transition to a
world industrial power; for Said, struggles over Palestinian statehood; and for
Mkandawire, opposition to strongman rule in Africa. For Mazrui, the climate was
that of decolonization, followed by political turbulence and punctuated by
military interventions. Moreover, these other four savants, together, represent
Mazrui’s intellectual heritage: Western, Middle Eastern, and African. Drawing
on their legacies, they trained their lenses on not only the intelligentsia but
also cultural values, practices, and policies, as does Mazrui. Collectively,
the interrogators provide a framing device for discovering nuance in Mazrui’s
scholarship. Let us now turn to their contentions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> These astute observers alike were quick to recognize
different types of intellectuals. Especially important is Gramsci’s (1 971 )
distinction between traditional and organic intellectuals. Be they teachers,
ecclesiastics, or bureaucrats, traditional intellectuals present themselves as
autonomous and independent of other social groups. In Gramsci’s telling, this
attempt to claim the mantle of a specialized function and unitary character is
a utopian quest, for intellectuals are a part of the complex of social
relations. Inasmuch as traditional intellectuals were connected to slavery in
the classical world and with the dominant order in China’s empires, they are in
no way detached from social and racial separations but hold on to the
privileges that derive from being a segment of a strong group. By contrast,
organic intellectuals are another stratum, also associated with a class. They
help to organize interests, articulate goals, seek to legitimize them, and
elicit consent. Usually, organic intellectuals are linked to an ascendant class
or movement. It is important not only to grasp the position of intellectuals in
a given social structure (i.e., with regard to class, race, ethnicity, gender,
and religious groups) but also in their relationship to power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Coming from another theoretical and political angle, Weber
(1973[1946]:176) maintains that intellectuals are a group that articulates
“cultural values” and propagates the “national idea.” He distinguished
intellectuals from a class of cultured “literati”: traditionalists who become
an exclusive stratum, seek to maintain the status quo and status privileges,
and throttle transformation. Further, Weber held that “an ethic of ultimate
ends and an ethic of responsibility are not absolute contrasts but rather supplements,
which only in unison constitute a genuine man—a man who  <i>can</i> have the
‘calling for politics’” (1973[1946]:127; emphasis in original). In a beautiful
passage, he urged diverse intellectuals to articulate the importance of
tolerance and respect for all groups, and to build a society with many vibrant
cultures: “Only he has the calling for politics who is sure that he shall not
crumble when the world from his point of view is too stupid and too base for
what he wants to offer. Only he who in the face of all this can say ‘In spite
of it all!’ has the calling for politics” (1973[1946]:128). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Also seeking reconciliation, particularly between
Palestinians and Israelis, Said, a Palestinian American political activist who
spent his childhood in Jerusalem and Cairo before becoming University Professor
of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, directly
addressed both the Western and postcolonial worlds. In his 1993 Reith Lectures
broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) (Said 1 994 ), Said
stressed that the intellectual represents a particular standpoint and is obliged
to disturb taken-for-granted knowledge. When intellectuals advocate for their
beliefs, whether by speaking, writing, mentoring, or making media appearances,
they incur grave risks. Moreover, they must draw inspiration from a steely
will, and have athlete-like stamina to sustain views that tilt against
convention. The point of it all is to unsettle the dominant order and etch
alternatives that are often marginalized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.95pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> These roles may land the intellectual in exile, as with
Said’s own station in New York. The exile condition may take the form of
displacement to another geographical place or a metaphorical state for
outsiders in their country of origin. The intellectual as an exile plays this
role not only by virtue of personal background but also by way of destabilizing
the extant knowledge-power structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:18.05pt;margin-bottom:
12.95pt;margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'> Exile is a model for the intellectual
who is tempted, and even beset and overwhelmed, by the rewards of
accommodation, yea-saying, settling in. Even if one is not an actual immigrant
or expatriate, it is still possible to think as one, to think and imagine in
spite of barriers, and always to move away from centralizing authorities toward
the margins, where you see things that are usually lost on minds that have
never traveled beyond the conventional and comfortable. (1994:63) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> To speak personally, I find Said’s contention that the
exile condition is not merely a matter of one’s passport to be compelling. It
may offer solace to scholars dislodged from their “homeland.” But what is a
“homeland?” <sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:105%'> 2 </span></sup> Line-drawing
between being inside and outside of one’s “homeland”—the inclusion of friends
and the exclusion of strangers—is a process of social construction. After all,
how do discourse brokers fashion a keyword such as “homeland security”? And in
what manner is the meaning appropriated so as to form categories of outsiders,
even within territorial borders? In our age, the U.S. government’s wordsmiths
have long claimed that it aimed to protect its own (read “homeland”) citizens
against “terrorist organizations,” and, in 1986, placed Nelson Mandela’s
African National Congress (ANC) on its secret watch list of terrorists. Only in
2008, fifteen years after Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize, did Washington
relent and delist the ANC. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> In view of such policies, dissident intellectuals in the
United States and elsewhere have sought to rock the power structure. Some of us
could easily identify with Said’s notion that one can be an exile, an outsider
looking in, including in one’s country of origin. For me, it is being a
critical thinker, an outlier, observing the insiders in Washington, D.C., where
a throng of policy intellectuals, among them think tankers, serve as what I
seem to recall Said once dubbed “therapists for the state and for power in our
societies.” In Said’s sense, and according to postcolonial theory, for which he
was a catalyst, identity formation is a question of Othering, that is, naming
“we” and “they” and using this designation for a political project. The point
is that fence-building is central to the postcolonial context as well as to the
everyday lives of diasporic peoples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> This intersubjective condition is similarly about
standpoint epistemology, which is central to gender analysis: mindfulness of
where one is situated in a social and spatial hierarchy. Viewing things both
from the lens of what he or she has seen elsewhere and comparing it to a new
domicile, the intellectual has the advantage of a double outlook that helps
develop universal ideas about human dignity and rights while taking into
account contingency— respect for beginnings and evolving processes on which institutions
are built rather than “being awed by the august personality” (Said 1 994 :61). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Like Said, Mkandawire knows the exile condition and is
concerned with knowledge production, especially in higher education at research
organizations in postcolonial Africa. A Swedish national who was imprisoned
under President Hastings Banda in his home country of Malawi, Mkandawire holds
the Chair in African Development at the London School of Economics and
Political Science. Putting forth germinal ideas in the  <i>CODESRIA Bulletin</i>
(Mkandawire 1 995 ; also see Mkandawire 2 010 ), he identified three generations
of indigenous researchers in Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Mostly educated overseas, the first generation helped
fashion and propagate the state’s developmentalist ideology. It established
pan-African research networks and institutions like the Council for the
Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA), which set out to
decolonize national organizations and invigorate the intellectual community.
Also trained abroad, many members of the second generation returned home but
became disenchanted owing to the constraints on intellectual production and joined
the brain drain. In Africa, they encountered intractable problems, including
limited professional opportunity in university positions taken by the first
generation, economic downturn, the decay of African states, and increasing
pressures on academic freedom. Hence a wave of academic refugees became
economic refugees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Largely produced locally, indubitably under onerous
conditions, the third generation of social scientists is increasingly at the
helm of African universities. Early on, they encountered a multitude of experts
who brought structural adjustment and technical assistance programs but not
durable educational infrastructure, such as adequate libraries and technology.
Mkandawire’s hope is that this generation will “initiate an autonomous
discourse and reflection on Africa—autonomous not in the sense that it is isolated
but in the sense that it takes the specificities of the African experience
seriously and has a proactive rather than reactive relationship with
non-African scholarship” (1995:11). <sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:105%'> 3 </span></sup> Now that efforts to rehabilitate African
universities and vitalize its research networks are afoot, it will be
worthwhile to take this vision into account in what follows on Mazrui’s
contributions. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> A Maverick Course </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> How does Mazrui’s intellectual legacy
measure up on this matrix of emphases: social embeddedness (Gramsci),
responsibility (Weber), representations (Said), and autonomous discourses
(Mkandawire)? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> It must first be said that Mazrui is a maverick, an
iconoclast who does not fit easily into any one slot, be it in the mainstream
or currents that cut against it. Admirers and critics have chronicled his
decades-long intellectual journey (Kokole 1 998 ; Morewedge 2 001 ). Mazrui’s
fans have provided eloquent tributes to his prolificacy and versatility.
Volumes of his collected essays (among them, Mazrui 2 002 ) themselves are
testimony to his tireless efforts to stimulate the exchange of knowledge. If the
young Mazrui (e.g., 1967a, 1967c) was steeped in political philosophy and
political sociology, Mazrui the elder is more on the sociological and cultural
side. In these domains, he exhibits great scope and ability to stir debates
among Africanists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Whereas political thought remains one of his principal
concerns, he has veered more toward examining cultural hybridity and capturing
the fluidity of flows in Africa (e.g., Mazrui, Dikirr, &amp; Kafrawi 2 008 ).
An intellectual pluralist trekking across disciplinary borders, Mazrui eagerly
enters sensitive terrains, including those of gender, religion, race,
ethnicity, and identity. He has engaged in controversies over Afrocentrism,
religiosity, anti-Semitism, the language question in Africa, neocolonialism, and
nuclear proliferation. Mazrui is an intellectual provocateur in an exhilarating
way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.8pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Let us now pursue this theme. Setting up global dialogues
with other intellectuals will give Mazrui a forum for displaying his skills as
an analyst, his penchant for dancing with words, and, I dare say, his sheer
pluck. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Gramsci and Mazrui </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> From early in the postcolonial period,
Mazrui has been a pioneer. For example, his initial foray into the construct
“global Africa” was avant-garde in the scholarly literature. He provided an
anticipation of research on the ways in which globalization touches down on the
continent and the responses to these forces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Yet imagine an encounter between Gramsci and Mazrui.
Gramsci would ask, “Are you a traditional intellectual holding fast to
privilege or an organic intellectual linked to a popular class or movement?
Whom do you stand for? Which elements in the social and power structure?” A
member of the Communist Party who wrote from an Italian prison during the
Mussolini years, Gramsci sought to overturn the dominant system of material and
political power. Attuned to cultural dynamics, he would query: “Why, Ali Mazrui,
do you find an analysis that focuses on meanings and whole ways of life more
compelling than studies that link material culture to critical political
economy? Do you emphasize the ideational aspects of culture and underemphasize
their material dimensions?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.8pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> In fact, an influential school in cultural studies and
some feminists build on the tradition of cultural materialism pioneered by
Marvin Harris (2001[1968]), who was decisively influenced by his fieldwork in
Mozambique. If he were with us today, Gramsci might well say: “True, you do not
ignore capitalist power (Mazrui 1 990 ). Yet as you well know, giants in
African studies, such as the historian Walter Rodney, the political scientist
Claude Ake, the poet Dennis Brutus, and the law professor Issa Shivji, have
advanced vigorous critiques of capitalism, understood as a mode of production
and a system of accumulation, truly an engine of dispossession in Africa. And
you, Ali? Please elaborate your position.” </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Weber and Mazrui </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> In the next imaginary dialogue, Weber
would applaud Mazrui’s focus on leaders and authority types. His selection of
notables includes several heads of state: among others, Idi Amin, Nnamdi
Azikiwe, Félix Houphet-Böigny, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Kwame
Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, and Milton Obote. August personalities in literature
and the arts plus Nobelists like Wangari Maathai and, also named a laureate in
2011, Johnson Sirleaf, receive attention, too. As highlighted in the title of
one of Mazrui’s books,  <i>On Heroes and Uhuru-Worship</i> (1967b), heroism is
a major theme coursing through Mazrui’s work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Akin to Weber’s approach, Mazrui’s relies on moral
reasoning and stresses the responsibility of intellectuals to bring to the fore
diverse cultural values. Surely the culturally laden exercise of naming heroes
and antiheroes is a way of bracketing the world. Heroism variously involves
legitimation of certain values, myth-making, and the identification of
individuals and groups as villains. The cultural motif of heroism is played out
differently in diverse civilizations. In the Western tradition, as in the mythology
of ancient Greece and Rome, classics like Homer’s  <i>Iliad</i> , and, later,
Shakespeare’s kings, heroic violence is romanticized. And with the rise of
modernity, Karl Marx sought to tie heroism and violence under capitalism:
“Unheroic though bourgeois society is, it nevertheless needed heroism,
sacrifice, terror, civil war, and national wars to bring it into being”
(1852:116, as quoted in Jung 2 003 :10). Steering clear of this dialectic,
Weber (1973[1946]) looked at heroes as superior individuals. For him, heroism
is an attribute that leaders strive to attain. It is what enables them to reach
the possible, though, time and again, it appeared impossible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> In the African context, Ng &#361; g &#297; wa Thiong’o
(1986) eloquently underscored that colonialism erased peoples’ memories, and
told other stories about their history. With decolonization, nationalism
invented new heroic narratives. The postcolonial order memorialized and
monumentalized its storylines. These are largely tales of male heroism. They
associate heroism with masculinity and strength. But the old order cried out at
the changes, some of them transmitted through Western educational institutions.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.85pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> The Ugandan novelist and poet Okot p’Bitek expressed it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> So, too, Weber painted a picture of massive historical and
cultural shifts. His opus featured the iron cage of bureaucratic rationality,
and stimulated creative responses to the quandary of whether and how it could
be unlocked. Interested in myriad cultures, Weber would want to know, “How, do
you Ali Mazrui, in your role as a leading African social scientist, go about
painting an alternative canvas? What is your framework that springs from
African soil?” In this vein, one might note that the title of Mazrui’s book  <i>On
Heroes and Uhuru-Worship</i> , according to the author, “advisedly . . . echoes
Thomas Carlyle’s famous glorification of the role of heroes and hero-worship in
history” (1967b:19). Discussing Josiah Mwangi Kariuki’s treatise “ <i>Mau Mau</i>”<i>
Detainee</i> (1963), Mazrui, again invoking Carlyle’s  <i>On Heroes, Hero
Worship and the Heroic in History</i> [1840]), supports his argument on heroism
as follows: “‘Give me a leader!’—this had been the passionate central thesis of
Carlyle’s philosophy” and of the Kikuyu generations later (1967b:19). Yet
Mazrui’s interlocutor would elicit more about the use of the proviso
“advisedly” in his own work. Not to put too fine a point on it, Mazrui needs to
explain what he means. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Curious about civilizations beyond European borders, Weber
would also interject: “I use authority types as a guide to selecting heroes.
Ali Mazrui, what is your compass for identifying iconic figures?” Indeed, it
could be argued that the African pantheon contains an assemblage of slain
heroes: among them, Steve Biko, Amilcar Cabral, Chris Hani, Patrice Lumumba,
Eduardo Mondlane, and Samora Machel (who died under suspicious circumstances).
The scholar-activists on the list would include Ruth First. “And more
generally, where are the voices of the women in your writings? How is
patriarchy portrayed?” (a debate played out vehemently in Mazrui [1998a,
1998b]; see also Ogundipe-Leslie [1998]). “Are the marginalized given
sufficient scope? The unsung heroes?” While not a feminist, Weber, the cultural
theorist, plumbed multiple levels of social structure in his account of the
rise of capitalism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> As mentioned, Weber linked social theory to a universalist
understanding of responsibility. In  <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
Capitalism</i> (1958), questions of ethics involved “the spirit of capitalism.”
These norms featured a growing competitive ethos, today a motor of change,
including in the intellectual domain. Consider the contemporary marketplace of
ideas. In our own universe of knowledge production, what are the
responsibilities of professors in the face of ideational circulation
surrounding competition wherein a hierarchical, managerialist spirit typifies
universities and is a driver of the downloading of globalizing ideas? </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Said and Mazrui </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> Relishing spirited debates and fond of
hectoring political authorities, Said chimed with these points about the
responsibilities of academics and representations of the margins. Certainly,
Said, a member of the Palestine National Council, the legislative body of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, until he split with Yasser Arafat, gave
voice to the anguish and aspirations of the fringes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Said emphasized the importance of the role of the public
intellectual. Nowadays, in fact, our institutions of higher education seem to
be producing too few of them. On this count, Mazrui has taken center stage.
Like Said, he delivered the Reith Lectures and has sought to decenter
knowledge, though Mazrui’s critics challenge the veracity of his claims. Mazrui
has also made numerous media appearances, has engaged power holders in
political discourse about democratic participation, and has taken risks. Moreover,
his views have reached general audiences through his novel  <i>The Trial of
Christopher Okigbo</i> (1971) and his nine-hour BBC/Public Broadcasting System
television documentary series  <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i> , which
contends that the modern history of Africa is a convergence of indigenous,
Islamic, and Western cultures. <sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:
105%'> 4 </span></sup> It triggered protests, including from one of its
funders, the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities under Lynne Cheney, on
the ground that the presentation was “an anti-Western diatribe” and that it
“lacked balance and objectivity” (Frank 1 998 :304). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Said would likely respond differently, and query Mazrui:
“Whose voices do you represent?” Said might well sharpen his probe: “Do your
representations incorporate the voices of the oppressed? Do you account for
their everyday lives? Or have you bleached the grassroots?” The feminist
scholar and activist Molara Ogundipe-Leslie goes further. She lambastes him for
essentialism, reductionism, and intellectual gamesmanship (see Mazrui  1998b ).
As she frames it, Why are you entitled to affix “the tag ‘an African
perspective’” to your article (1998:251)? More broadly, postcolonial theory
frames the ethical dilemma facing researchers irrespective of their national or
regional origins: Who authorizes whom to represent others? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Picking up on this theme, Wole Soyinka (1 991 ,  2000 )
and Archie Mafeje ( 1995a,   1995b , 1 998 ) chastised Mazrui for his alleged
misrepresentations of Africa. Passionate in their beliefs, our elders tossed
civility to the winds. They quickly dispensed with scholarly protocol, as
spelled out, for example, in the 1990 “Kampala Declaration on Intellectual
Freedom and Social  <i>Responsibility</i> ” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>(my emphasis), which was adopted at a
CODESRIA symposium in which Mazrui participated. Ethical standards of
responsibility, especially to a younger generation looking up to their role
models, were cast aside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> The ensuing Soyinka&#8210;Mazrui and Mafeje&#8210;Mazrui
fights turned into slugfests among intellectual warriors. As the rounds heated
up, Mazrui ( 1991,   1992,   1995b , 1 995c , 2 000 , 2 008a ) assumed a role
represented in his own writings: the warrior tradition in African politics (see
Mazrui  1977 ). Mazrui’s offensive against Soyinka and Mafeje was redolent of
the foremost classical theorist of war, Carl von Clausewitz, known for his
maxim that war and politics are inextricably interrelated (1968[1832]). Clausewitz
provided a rudimentary sociology that began to treat warfare as a social
institution. Mindful that patriots in the revolutionary French army believed
that they were fighting for rights throughout Europe, he had great respect for
the power of ideas. And in a twenty-first-century reformulation of the
Clausewitzian dictum that war is politics by other means, Michel Foucault held
that “politics is the continuation of war by other means.” Political power, he
wrote, relies on “a silent war . . . to reinscribe it in institutions, economic
inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals” (2003:15,16). In
other words, power is a warlike operation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> The power/conflict interplay is evocative of the Mazrui&#8210;Soyinka&#8210;Mafeje
dynamics. Going all out, these heavyweights punched below the belt. For
instance, Mazrui’s rivals alleged that his writings and lectures are
self-indulgent and that he cultivates a following, even intellectual heroism, a
theme that we will revisit. In return, Mazrui unleashed a powerful
counterattack. In intellectual combat, he parried deftly. Matched against
Soyinka and Mafeje, Mazrui, like a world champ, showed an uncanny ability to “float
like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” Floored by these no-holds-barred bouts,
and safely tucked in the audience, I mixed up my Alis—Mazrui and Muhammad. In
an imaginary brawl between them, the wily professor might have even come to a
draw with the poet-philosopher-boxer, who spoke out on matters of race,
culture, Islam, war, peace, and tolerance. Professor Ali would not have backed
down. Perhaps he would have said: “Muhammad, you traveled to Kinshasa for a
rumble with George Foreman, and I challenge you to come to Mombasa to debate
me.” Many people there would have enthusiastically greeted the professional
boxer, not only because he is held in high regard, but also because, in Swahili
communities, the name Muhammad Ali is quite common. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.4pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Or am I now emulating the genre of Ali Mazrui, whose harsh
detractors claim that he toys with words and spins spurious associations? </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Mkandawire and Mazrui </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> Mazrui’s fortitude is remarkable. Bear in
mind that his career stretches from the early years of political independence
in Africa to the present. Chronologically, he spans the three generations that
Mkandawire (1 995 ) depicted. Given Mazrui’s verve, if not nerve, who knows?
Perhaps the next generation, two, or three as well? He keeps sprinting toward a
better intellectual future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> A former CODESRIA executive secretary, Mkandawire has made
a major intellectual impact, one aspect of which is the emphasis on the need
for rigor in African studies. His legacy at CODESRIA includes the creation of
research networks, publications, forums, and institutes that emphasize
methodology, some of them specifically for young laureates. Accordingly, one
could conjure an exchange in which Mkandawire, an economist, queries Mazrui,
the culturalist: “What are your methods? How do you carry out your research? Is
it rigorous or patchy?” Indeed, Mafeje (1 998 ) and other critics, like
Ogundipe-Leslie (1 998 ), have lampooned him for substituting vivid
alliteration, rich metaphor, and specious correlations for methodological due
diligence. The hecklers attempted to poke holes in his schema and maintained
that it is hardly bullet proof. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> While Mazrui is well-equipped to defend himself
explicitly, he builds his arguments implicitly, through textual analysis.
Edward Said, too, worked in this manner, albeit in the service of a different
political project. Said’s data are literary texts. Ideas are played off against
one another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Using mixed methods to supplement textual analysis, Mazrui
enlists concrete institutionalism (on pan-Africanism [1967c, 1997, 2005]),
comparative inquiry (with African and American political thought [1967a]), and
autoethnography (regarding gender and the family [1986, 1998a, 1998b, 2000]).
In a form of memory research employed by historians, some feminists, and
critical legal scholars, he mines his autobiography for material, as
illustrations of identity politics. In my reading, the point of it all is to provide
entrée to civilizational analysis. Mazrui leads his audiences into the mindset
of overlapping groupings, including Muslim and African diasporas, as they
interact with others and are deeply affected by cultural flows across borders.
Avoiding reductionism, he explores cultural complexity, exemplified by his own
Arab and African heritage. Mazrui opens worldviews and institutions, such as
his own extended family, to readers (see Institute of Global Cultural Studies
2006). But will this defense satisfy Mazrui’s critics, who expect systematic
information on, and explanations of, more than a one-time ruling family on the
coast of East Africa? Far from being anecdotal and quixotic, as his adversaries
contend, his work presents the microcosm as a way to see the big picture.
Mazrui uses analogical reasoning as a heuristic for connecting concrete
phenomena. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Still, what about the subaltern’s lived experience? Is the
civilizational talk among intellectuals elitist? Does it engage the discourses
of East Africa’s  <i>wananchi</i> (citizens), in the sense of ordinary people?
Are the academics actually listening to them? When I put my ear to the ground
in the region’s villages and poverty-stricken urban areas, the people’s wants
are expressed in terms of  <i>chakula</i> (food),  <i>maji</i> (water),  <i>kazi</i>
(work),  <i>afya</i> (health),  <i>elimu</i> (education), and the like. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> If I may again assume his own inimitable style, Mazrui is
a great  <i>conceptualizer</i> but not a great  <i>particularizer</i> of
empirical evidence. To be sure, he digs empirically. But the excavations are
not as empirically thoroughgoing as some observers demand. Methodologically,
the litmus is no less than the meticulous production of knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Like Weber, Mazrui is a methodological individualist. But
Weber was more reflective on questions of method and epistemology (1949). He
developed a methodology—ideal types—as a way to gather troves of data on
history and culture. While Mazrui also brings out the cultural accoutrements of
politics and social structure, he is the more eclectic workman. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> And like Mkandawire, whose job portfolio includes a stint
as director of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development,
Mazrui is an institution builder. Both Mkandawire’s and Mazrui’s professional
service encompasses the goal of buttressing and shaping the knowledge structure
in African studies. Mazrui has advised international agencies such as, inter
alia, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Bank; participated on
the editorial boards of several journals; held posts as a university
administrator, such as chancellor of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture
and Technology (Nairobi); and been active in professional associations,
including as president of the U.S.-based African Studies Association. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Whereas Mkandawire traced three generations of African
intellectuals, a fourth generation is rising. The future is upon us. Writing in
1995, Mkandawire looked ahead to the issue of regeneration of knowledge. Surely
his insight about generational differences is astute, especially given all the
attention he devotes to other axes of stratification: gender, race, ethnicity,
class, religious groupings, and so on. But does Mazrui endorse Mkandawire’s
characterization of generational diversity at African universities? And are
Mkandawire’s observations in need of updating? To what extent have value
systems changed? Does Mazrui find that Mkandawire’s 1 995 projection stands the
test of time? Does it hold up to closer scrutiny of today’s multigenerational
institutions in Africa? And what is Mazrui’s vision for the successor
generations? In what kind of environment can they best act as responsible
knowledge generators? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> For Mkandawire, greater intellectual autonomy is
warranted. To bolster research in Africa, the intelligentsia needs its own
space for debate and creativity as well as unfettered academic freedom.
Universities must be sanctuaries for critical reflection, though not
disembedded from societal conditions. In his plethora of publications and
lectures on this very theme, Mazrui endorses this general view. But exactly
what picture of universities does Mazrui draw? Beyond bemoaning the constraints
on African universities, he proposes an ecumenical tack for resuscitating them.
It involves redialing into, not disconnecting from, global perspectives. In a
chapter published in a book on rethinking the possibilities for African
intellectuals edited by Mkandawire (Mazrui  2005) , and in other venues, Mazrui
fleshes out several strategies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Counseling parametric change, Mazrui (1 995a ) prescribes
indigenization, but not cultural autarky. According to him, delinking would
only continue marginalization. Rather, decolonizing the university requires
broader diversification of its content: enabling local societies to have
broader influence on the curriculum, altering the criteria for recruitment of
faculty so as to embrace traditional skills, and revising the adoption of
Western disciplines whereby holistic concerns, such as rural development, become
schools in their own right. Paradoxically, more Africanization entails more
internationalization and multiculturalism. This is a matter of modifying
language requirements and emphasizing knowledge of regions such as Asia and
Latin America. Building on emerging market power, there is an opportunity for
enhanced South&#8210;South initiatives to “counterpenetrate” Western
educational systems. But for real reciprocity, African universities should
build capacity for creativity and innovation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Mazrui has extended these ideas for transforming
universities to incorporate the pursuit of “ecology-friendly production and
consumption in Africa,” which would guard against the deleterious effects of
industrialization (2008b:3). A main goal is mobilizing resources: in other
words, developing relations with the state and private donors. Specific ways to
move ahead have been mapped out, especially in addresses presented by Mazrui (2
003 ,  2011 ) in his role as university chancellor in Kenya. These notions are
bound to be contested. But entertaining controversy is his forte. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Punch Line </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'> The preceding discussion adopts a joyful
mode of celebrating Ali Mazrui’s many achievements. At root, however, it is not
intellectual play. This article affords an occasion to pose serious challenges.
Perhaps Mazrui will want to respond and make clear the analytical framework
undergirding his output. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The responses could help further African
studies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> In the foregoing dialogues, the inquisitors have raised a
host of questions. To wrap up, the following queries center on grappling with
the drivers of social transformation and, in a dynamic global milieu, what
makes Africa tick. The interlocutors want Ali Mazrui to step up to their
charges about how to theorize African conditions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.65pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;text-indent:0in;line-height:
107%'> In closing, let us pick up on four aspects of this exchange of ideas: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> First, do you emphasize agency at the expense of deep
structural forces? If not, how do they operate? What are the underlying
structures? Ideas? Material power? And how to join such factors? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Second, should the agents be construed as atomized
individuals with ample freedom of maneuver? Or are social individuals tethered
to resilient structures, as both Weber and Marx believed, even though, in their
prefigurations of globalizing forces, these theorists differed on the engines
of change? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Third, in view of persistent constraints, is the scope for
political leaders narrowing? Do methodological individualists grant too much
autonomy to them? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Fourth, how then can we expand policy space so as to build
ladders of development? How to advance in the hierarchy of the global division
of labor and power? For the welter of stakeholders in Africa, what are the
alternatives? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'> Getting high marks on this assignment is a tall order.
Likely, as proven over several decades, Mazrui will excel in advancing the
realization of a better intellectual community. It is safe to bet that he will
continue to contribute powerfully to winning a just future. Yet there is no
telling what surprises Mazrui has in store for us. You can rest assured that he
will not pull any punches. </p>

Gramsci and Weber echo my August 14, 1996, speech delivered as the Richard
Feetham Memorial Lecture on Academic Freedom in Africa (Mittelman 1 997 ), the
lecture series at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, that was
launched in1959, when Chancellor Richard Feetham and many of his colleagues
refused the government’s order, under the Separate University Education Bill,
to segregate the university. (Previously, Wits and the University of Cape Town
were “open universities,” and admitted students without regard to race or
color.) When the bill became a law, thousands of students and staff marched
through the streets protesting the state’s attempt to enforce apartheid in the
universities. For further analysis of academic freedom in Africa, see Diouf and
Mamdani (1 994 ), and Mazrui’s chapter in the same volume. </span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>It would be remiss
to fail to draw attention to a cornerstone of this thinking. Apposite to
comprehending the exile condition is the notion of  <i>nomos</i> , which for
the German philosopher and legal scholar Carl Schmitt ([1950] 2003), as
discussed in Mittelman (2 010 ), encapsulates the constitutive processes of
order and orientation. Orders are world historical events that may be
distinguished from one another, and manifest a political and juridical rule.
They also instill orientation, which springs from the local, the earth in a
spatial sense (as in an attachment to the land), and thus below the heights of
the economy and the state. So, too,  <i>nomos</i> entails enclosure: erecting
fences, drawing borderlines, and forming identities. In other words,  <i>nomos</i>
expresses orders that unite as well as divide. Inasmuch as history remains open
and fluid, a new  <i>nomos</i> may emerge. Tacit categories of superordinate
and subordinate groups are formed anew. They include the Other among people who
live amid one another. In this process, the constructs of homeland and internal
and external exile are defined or self-defined, as in Germany during the Nazi
period, when Schmitt, an ardent anti-Semite, aligned with the National
Socialist party and provided intellectual rationale for the “fatherland.” </span></p>
