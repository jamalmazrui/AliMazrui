align=left hspace=12>In November 2012, Ali Mazrui wrote an article titled
“Barack Obama: A great man, not yet a great president.” He said Barack Obama
was a great man but we would have to wait and see if he would become a great
president. That is a fair point, I think; but let me also venture to say this.
We would not have to wait any longer to say Ali A. Mazrui was a great man and a
great scholar. Now some reflections on this man of ideas—a beautiful mind. The
mathematical genius depicted in the 2001 Oscars-winning eponymous movie is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in'>called “a beautiful
mind”. And so was Ali A. Mazrui—a beautiful mind. It was this mind which
inspired me to write my first book <i>Paradigm Lost, Paradigm Regained: The
Worldview of Ali A. Mazrui </i>(2002), with a Foreword by Kazuto Suzuki, a
rising Japanese academic/diplomat and former colleague of mine at the
University of Tsukuba in Japan. So, here was an Ethiopian Oromo in Japan,
writing his first book, about a Kenyan in the United States; and the Ethiopian
had even never met the Kenyan before he wrote the book. Such was my passion for
Mazrui’s scholarship—a passion which, now I understand, is shared by so many in
Africa and around the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I first met Mazrui in the summer of
2002, in Binghamton, New York, when he invited me to his Institute of Global
Cultural Studies (IGCS) as a research associate. I was at the time teaching
political science just outside Tokyo, in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I could say that how I felt when I
met him for the first time was almost like what he had said he felt when he met
one of his intellectual heroes, James Coleman, in 1964 at the University of
Ibadan in Nigeria. Mazrui was intimately familiar with Coleman’s scholarship
before he met him; I too knew quite a bit about Mazrui’s scholarship before I
met him in person in 2002. Mazrui said there was an element of hero-worship in
his response when he met Coleman; I would say the same about my immediate
reaction when I met Mazrui.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
22.7pt;margin-left:0in'>These are two dialogues about and with Mazrui I wish to
have. I suppose, first, a social scientist approaches me and says: since I
never heard about Ali Mazrui, describe him for me in one or two sentences. I
will be tempted to retort: can there be a social scientist who has not heard
about Ali Mazrui? I allow for the possibility that this</p>

margin-left:16.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in'>social scientist was
from another planet before I concede that the question has nevertheless an
immediate relevance: how could we describe Ali Mazrui in one sentence? So, I
decided to summon up the judgments made by South Africa’s Nelson Mandela and
Ghana’s Kofi Annan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.1pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:16.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In 1995, Mandela wrote, Ali Mazrui is
“an outstanding educationist and a freedom fighter.” In 2000, Kofi Annan
described Mazrui as “Africa’s gift to the world.” (The quotations are not
imaginary.) I say to myself, I have found the answer to the intriguing
question. Ali Mazrui is “an outstanding educationist and freedom fighter, and
Africa’s gift to the world.” The other imaginary dialogue is with Mazrui
himself. In his <i>The Trial of Christopher Okigbo</i> (1971), Mazrui let his
fictional characters, all dead, speak to each other. But I wish to speak to
Mazrui directly. I ask him: “What do you think about the description of you by
Mandela and Kofi Annan?” His answer from AfterAfrica would have been something
like this. “First and foremost, let us bear in mind that Mandela’s description
of me is <i>mission-oriented</i>; and Annan’s description is <i>missionneutral</i>.”
(The phrases are my own coinage.) “If Mandela and Annan were slightly
exaggerating about my place in the Herebefore,” Mazrui would add, “their
exaggeration was logically respectable. The fact that one is in the
After-Africa and the other in the Herebefore is also only of marginal relevance
from the point of view of the matter under discussion. What is more significant
is the fact that both Mandela and Annan qualify as <i>Africans of the blood</i>
and <i>Africans of the soil</i>.” (The phrases are Mazrui’s coinage.) “By the
way,” Mazrui would say in closing, “life beyond the grave is vastly more
democratic than most religions in the Herebefore had implied.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:16.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>The New York Times</i> published
Ali Mazrui’s obituary by Douglas Martin on October 20, 2014: “Ali Mazrui,
Scholar of Africa Who Divided U.S. Audiences, Dies at 81”. If Mazrui was to
read this obituary, he would probably say that Martin has committed two of the
three sins of the media in the age of globalization, namely, the <i>sin of
commission </i>and <i>the sin of omission</i>. A factual error was committed in
Martin’s piece, the sin of commission, even if it originated elsewhere. The
error was in the claim that it was the governor of a school in Mombasa who sent
Ali Mazrui to Britain for his secondary education; in fact, it was the Governor
of Kenya, Sir Philip Mitchell, who did so. Then there was the sin of omission.
Martin mentions what the then Head of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, Lynne Cheney, had said objecting to the “anti-Western tone” of
Mazrui’s TV series, <i>The Africans</i>. But Martin “omitted”, advertently or
inadvertently, a statement made by the then Senator John Kerry of
Massachusetts. Kerry argued that the TV series had to be shown to the American
audience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:23.15pt;
margin-left:16.9pt'>I agreed with Mazrui’s imaginary stance, but I did not wish
to stop there. I did what I thought Mazrui would have done under the
circumstances: write to the editors directly and point out this sin of omission
and set the record straight. One of the things I decided to do after we laid
Mazrui’s body to rest in Mombasa, Kenya, was therefore to write the following
letter to <i>The New York Times</i>:</p>

13.95pt;margin-left:13.8pt;text-indent:-.5pt;line-height:134%'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:134%'>Douglas Martin’s “Ali Mazrui, Scholar
of Africa Who Divided U.S. Audiences, Dies at 81” (Oct. 20) appears to minimize
Mazrui’s legacy, however inadvertently. Martin suggests that Mazrui’s 1986 TV
series, <i>The Africans</i>, was about Africa and nuclear weapons. It was much
more than that. If Mazrui had said in the 1980s that Africa should go nuclear,
it was an idea which he quickly abandoned, and since then, he has written
extensively on a wide range of topics. Martin mentions Lynne Cheney’s strong
reservations about the series which her institution partially funded. For
“balance”, Martin should probably have also referred to what the then Senator
John Kerry said about Mazrui’s TV series: “While I cannot endorse all of the
conclusions [of the TV series][…] its showing has provided the American people
with an all-too-rare look at Africa from an African perspective.” Additionally,
such a quote could have reinforced what the title implied.</span></p>

0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in'>Unfortunately, it
was not published, but, separately, I drew the editors’ attention to the
aforementioned sin of commission. The editor was quick to admit the error, in
effect, and add the following at the bottom of the online obituary: “An earlier
version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the person who was impressed
by a speech Mr. Mazrui gave on the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, leading to new
educational opportunities. It was the governor of Kenya, not the governor of
the technical school where he was working as a clerk.” I drew one conclusion
from my first-hand experience with <i>The New York Times</i>. In journalism, as
in some other vocations, committing a factual error is viewed as perhaps a more
deadly sin than omitting a relevant fact. Or, is it the case that what is a
relevant fact—like beauty—is in the eye of the beholder?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Was I Mazrui’s “right-hand man”? One
of Mazrui’s sons used to describe me in those terms in any case, and Mazrui
himself seemed genuinely appreciative of my contribution to the Institute. He
wrote in 2012: “I can say categorically that one of the most valuable things
which have happened to the Institute of Global Cultural Studies in the last two
decades has been the appointment of Seifudein Adem.” I was in charge of the
affairs of the Institute when Mazrui was on his extended lecture tours
nationally and abroad, including teaching his classes and my own. But why
should I believe what he said about me? The answer is simple—he didn’t have to
say it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
22.7pt;margin-left:0in'>Mazrui gave me the opportunity to develop myself
intellectually by enabling me to learn more about him and his scholarship in
different settings. I often accompanied him during his numerous lecture tours.
I must admit I was sometimes mistaken for his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:16.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in'>son, especially in
the airports. I was, therefore, most eager to know what Mazrui thought about my
familiarity with his scholarship. And that day came in February 2013, when I
received from him an email titled “Mazruiana for Heirs”. In the list of recipients
of that email were also members of his family. The email contained Mazrui’s
books, articles, lectures, reports, tapes, and so forth. The message in part
read: “…you are the primary heirs—though Seifudein may know more about my work
than most of any family-members!!” And, in closing, it said: “When I am gone
you may find this ‘guide to Mazruiana’ very helpful for the record.” I was
greatly encouraged by Mwalimu’s open testimonials, especially coming as it did
in the evening hours of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.1pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:16.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Mazrui had also made other
observations about me. On one occasion, he told me I was often successful in
disguising my originality. At first I did not know whether he was suggesting
that that was a good or bad thing. On another occasion, he wondered why I was
often too deferential. In response, I said, that was perhaps due to my
Ethiopian up-bringing and my extended stay in Japan. I had lived in Japan for
thirteen years. On yet another occasion, he rhetorically asked me: “Who is the
Director of this Institute, you or me?” He was apparently less pleased with the
administrative assertiveness I occasionally dared to show. The years I was
blessed to spend with Mwalimu were extremely rewarding to me not only in the
opportunity they offered to study him and his scholarship intensively and
closely but also in the simulative effect they had on the growth of my
intellect. Thanks to him, I have come to know what I had not known before,
including some things about myself. Most importantly, I hope, I have learned
one thing from him: learning how to learn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:16.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In a letter I wrote to Mazrui on
October 6, 2013, about one month before he was hospitalized (on November 10,
2013), I sought to reflect on the shared benefits of our scholarly bond. The
letter, which was also copied for not so mysterious reason to the chairs of
three academic departments at Binghamton University, included the following
passage:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:13.45pt;margin-bottom:
13.95pt;margin-left:31.55pt;text-indent:-.5pt;line-height:134%'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:134%'>In the past seven years, you have
given me the opportunity to work with you closely, allowing me to explore
different areas of inquiry. The topics range from Africa’s experience to
Japan’s predicament and from the end of the Cold War to the rise of China, and
so forth. But your vast scholarship, too, has been a stimulating research
project for me. In this context consider, for example, my two books which were
published in 2013, and the other two, which are forthcoming before end of the
year. These books are either about you, or are co-authored with you, or have in
them a chapter by you—also a clear evidence of the fruitfulness and maturity of
our intellectual partnership.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:23.15pt;
margin-left:16.9pt;text-indent:0in'>One of the last professional acts of Ali

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In his writings, generally, Mazrui
loved to use three rhetorical devices: rhyme, alliteration, and tricolon. His
magic number was therefore three. As those of us who taught classes with him
know, even the themes of some of Mazrui’s lectures came in “triads”. Mazrui’s
flagship concept was, of course, Africa’s <i>Triple Heritage</i> which,
incidentally, Wole Soyinka once sought to debunk by calling it, rather cruelly,
Mazrui’s “Triple Tropes of Trickery”. These are in any case examples of triples
which Mazrui contrived for his discourse. Now let me relate a positive story
about the triple events of 2013, it is a story about Mazrui and I, one year
before he passed away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.35pt;margin-bottom:

birthday under the auspices of the 38th annual meeting of the New York African
Studies Association in Binghamton which I organized. The meeting was praised as
best ever. If so, I have no doubt that that was mainly due to Mazrui’s
international superstardom. Attendees at the event included the former Head of
State of Nigeria, Yakubu Gowon; the noted Kenyan writer, Ngugi˜ ˜ wa Thiong’o;
President of Binghamton University, Harvey Stenger; Vice Chancellor of Makerere
University in Uganda, Ddumba Sentamu; Director of the South Africabased Center
for Conflict Resolution, Adekeye Adebajo; and many other distinguished guests.
