document thethe IIIT, several points need to be identified for clarification
and understand-ing. First of all, how did Ali engage the founders and staff of
the IIIT? To thebest of my knowledge, Ali, who has been active in African and
Islamic studies,was acquainted with the late Ismail Faruqi. Although I cannot
identify pre-cisely the date and occasion when the two gentlemen knew each
other, how-ever, I could assert categorically here that they started
communicating andexchanging messages until the demise of the
Palestinian-American colleague.Truth be told, Ali and Ismail met face-to-face
in my presence at a conferenceorganized by the Unificationalist movement held
in Miami in the same yearwhen former President Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter.

others from other faith com-munities around the world. Ismail Faruqi was then
