margin-left:-.25pt'>n 12 October 2014 Africa – and the world – lost one of its
greatest sons with the passing of renowned Pan-Africanist, scholar and teacher,
Prof Ali Mazrui. He died aged 81 at his home in Vestal, New York, following
several months of illness.         Born in Mombasa, Kenya, Prof Mazrui was one
of the world’s most prolific writers on Africa, its people, history and future.
In a career stretching over 50 years he authored and co-authored more than 40
books as well as hundreds of articles in major scholastic journals and for
public media. In this way, he profoundly influenced ideas about Africa among
scholars and members of the general public alike.                Described as a
free thinker who would not distort the truth and facts to the dictates of the
establishment, Prof Mazrui’s views did not always sit well with some audiences,
yet his powerful writing style made it impossible for even his harshest critics
to ignore the unique perspective he brought to a variety of African issues. The
subject matter of his writings ranged from politics, sociology, philosophy,
languages, literature, history, heritage, religion, to spirituality, and
demanded that people from all walks of life participate and contribute to
discourse and dialogue.       His soft-spoken charm and eloquence as a lecturer
also made him a favourite among students at every university he served. <span
style='color:#141823'>So revered was he as a teacher and mentor that family and
friends referred to him as ‘Mwalimu’ (Swahili for teacher).              At the
time of his death, Prof Mazrui was the Albert Schweitzer Professor in the
Humanities and Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies at
Binghamton University, State University of New York. </span></p>

outside of academia in 1986 when he wrote and hosted the nine-part television
series, <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i>. The show’s subtitle refers to
the three legacies – Islamic, indigenous and Western – that have been most
apparent in the formation of modern African identity.              Wrote the
South African Presidency in 2007: “Prof Mazrui is one of the greatest minds
ever to have been produced by the African continent. His prolific writing,
coupled with the variety of fields he has been covering in his academic life
proves the versatility of his intellect. He has put the African continent on
the pedestal, unearthing and laying bare the grandeur of Africa to a world that
had been but paying marginal attention to the intellectual depth of the African
continent.”</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>Prospect ranked Mazrui among the top 100 public
intellectuals in the world.       In November 2012, the Water Research
Commission (WRC) was privileged to host Prof Mazrui as a special keynote
speaker at the International Conference on Freshwater Governance for
Sustainable Development, held in the Drakensberg. Here he emphasised our inextricable
link with water not only as it sustains life, but also in terms of culture,
religion and heritage. “The issue of water affects the farmer praying for rain,
affects a villager in fear of a hurricane, affects a mother terrified </p>

by that of the WRC.  In the words of lifelong friend Burjor Avari, honorary
research fellow at Manchester Metropolitan University, Prof Mazrui wanted the
people of his beloved continent to enjoy the benefits of modern science and
technology and become more prosperous.  His eldest sons, Jamal, Alamin and Kim
posted a heart-warming tribute to their father on Facebook: “Our father’s love
of life leaves us all to pause and consider more deeply: what would we be, what
could we be, if we moved beyond fear and anxiety and embraced, as he did – our
incredible human potential and the fulfilment of life in all of its glory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:113%'><span
style='color:#333333'>                Says WRC CEO Dhesigen Naidoo: “Baba
Mazrui’s empowering contribution has been to demonstrate that harsh corners of
fundamentalism and discrimination can be smoothed through the calmness of
intellectual enquiry, paving the way for a more informed dialogue to sow the
seeds of sustainable solutions. His legacy will continue to inspire Africa and
all her partners for many generations to come.”            Prof Mazrui was laid
to rest according to his wishes in the 900-year-old Mazrui  family cemetery in
old town Mombasa. He is survived by his wife, Pauline, five sons and a
daughter. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:113%;font-family:
