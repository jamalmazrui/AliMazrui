October 12, 2014 of natural causes at his home in Vestal, New York, surrounded
by family.  A political scientist, Mazrui was the Albert Schweitzer Professor
in the Humanities and Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies at
Binghamton University, State University of New York, until his retirement on
September 1, </p>

Professor-at-Large Emeritus and Senior Scholar in Africana Studies at Cornell
University and as the Albert Luthuli Professor-at-Large at the University of
Jos, Nigeria.  He was a renowned scholar, teacher and public intellectual with
expertise in African politics, international political culture, political
Islam, and North-South relations.  His prolific writing over the past half
century has shaped ideas about Africa and Islam among scholars and the general
public, earning him both international acclaim and controversy.  He authored
over forty books and hundreds of scholarly articles and book chapters.  His
political analyses appeared frequently in news media around the world.  He is
best known for the ninepart television series he wrote and narrated, The
Africans: A Triple Heritage.  A joint production of BBC and PBS, the series
originally aired in numerous countries in 1986.  The series, and the book on
which it is based, reveals and analyzes the complex ways in which African
communities exhibit a blend of three cultures: indigenous, Muslim and Western. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui’s own upbringing reflects this
triple heritage.  He was born on February 24, 1933, in Mombasa, Kenya, to
Swafia Suleiman Mazrui and Sheikh Al-Amin Mazrui, an eminent Muslim scholar and
the Chief Qadi (Islamic judge) of Kenya.  Immersed in Swahili culture, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Islamic law, and Western education, he grew up speaking or
reading Swahili, Arabic and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>English.  He pursued his higher education in the West,
obtaining his B.A. from Manchester University in England (1960); his M.A. from
Columbia University in New York (1961); and his doctorate (D.Phil.) from Oxford
University in England (1966).  While studying in England, he married his first
wife, Molly Vickerman, and they began a family in Kampala, Uganda, where he
launched his academic career at Makerere University.  He taught at Makerere for
ten years, during which his first three sons were born: Jamal (1963), Alamin
(1967) and Kim Abubakar (1968).  At Makerere, he served as head of the
Department of Political Science, Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences, and
Dean of the Faculty of Law.  During his tenure at Makerere, dictator Idi Amin
became increasingly repressive toward critics, ultimately forcing Mazrui into
exile with his family to the United States. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui’s career in the U.S. began at
Stanford University, where he visited for two years (1972-74).  He then joined
the Political Science Department at the University of Michigan for seventeen
years (1974-91), where he also served as Director of the Center for
Afro-American and African Studies (1978-81).  In 1989, the State of New York
recruited him to Binghamton </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>University to assume the Albert Schweitzer Chair in the
Humanities, previously occupied by Toni Morrison.  At Binghamton, he founded
the Institute of Global Cultural Studies and regularized his at-large
affiliation with Cornell University.  In 1991, he married Pauline Uti of Jos,
Nigeria.  They had two sons, Farid (1992) and Harith (1993), and adopted a
daughter Grace (b. 2004) in 2012.  </p>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui’s publications are influential and
voluminous.  He made his mark early in his career, before completing his
doctoral studies, when in 1963 he published articles in the most prestigious
political science journals in the United States and Britain: “On the Concept of
‘We Are All Africans,’” <i>The American Political Science Review</i> (Mar.
1963) and “Consent, </p>

Towards a Pax Africana: A Study of Ideology and Ambition (1967); On Heroes and
Uhuru-Worship: Essays on Independent Africa (1967); and The Anglo-African
Commonwealth: Political Friction and Cultural Fusion (1967). </p>

prestigious annual Reith lectures that Mazrui delivered in 1979 for the BBC. 
His book, The Power of Babel: Language and Governance in Africa’s Experience
(co-authored with nephew Alamin M. Mazrui) (1998) was launched in the British
House of Lords at a ceremony honoring Mazrui’s work.  He and Alamin M. Mazrui
also published Black Reparations in the Era of Globalization (2002).  The
project stemmed from his appointment in 1992 as one of twelve Eminent Persons
by the Organization of African Unity Presidential Summit in order to explore
the modalities and logistics of reparations for enslavement and colonization. 
He also published a novel, The Trial of Christopher Okigbo (1971), which was
inspired by his anguish over the Nigerian civil war and the tragic death of a
childhood friend, Mohamed Salim Said (nicknamed “Giraffe”).  For an annotated
bibliography of Mazrui’s work, comprehensive to date of press, see The
Mazruiana Collection Revisited (Abdul S. Bemath ed., 2005).  Books containing
scholarly papers about Mazrui’s work include The Global African: A Portrait of
Ali A. Mazrui (Omari H. Kokole ed., 1998) and the Politics of Global Africa
(Seifudein Adem ed., 2011). </p>

Australia, Baghdad, Bridgewater, Cairo, Chicago, Colgate, Denver, Guyana,
Harvard, Leeds, London, Malaysia, McGill, Nairobi, Ohio State, Oxford,
Pennsylvania, Singapore, Sussex, Teheran, UCLA and Washington.  Kenyan
President Mwai Kibaki appointed him Chancellor of Jomo Kenyatta University of
Agriculture &amp; Technology in Nairobi, Kenya, a position he held for six
years (2003-09).  He was awarded honorary doctorates by several universities in
such varied disciplines as Divinity, Sciences of Human Development, Humane
Letters, and Political Economy.  He also served in leadership roles in several
organizations, including as President of the Muslim Social Scientists of North
America and President of the African Studies Association of the United States. 
He also served as Chair of the Board of the Center for the Study of Islam and
Democracy and as Special Advisor to the World Bank.  Mazrui was a principal contributor
to several United Nations projects on matters of global significance, such as
human rights and nuclear proliferation.  He served as editor, for example, of
Volume VIII (Africa since 1935) of the UNESCO General History of Africa (1993),
and as Expert Advisor to the United Nations Commission on Transnational

made him Grand Companion of Oliver Tambo.  Morgan State University awarded him
the DuBois-Garvey Award for Pan-African Unity.  In 2005, the American journal <i>Foreign
Policy</i> and the British journal <i>Prospect</i> ranked Mazrui among the top
100 public intellectuals in the world.  He was also featured in the “500 Most
Influential Muslims,” (a.k.a. the “Muslim 500”), a publication by the Royal
Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in cooperation with the Prince Alwaleed Center

His passion, eloquence, and charisma as a lecturer filled classes throughout
his teaching career.  Similarly, his reputation for insightful analysis and
moving oratory created standing-room only audiences at public speaking events
throughout the world.  Indeed, his “Millennium Harvard lectures” drew large,
engaged audiences </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>for three consecutive days.  (The lectures were
subsequently published as The African Predicament and the American Experience:
A Tale of Two Edens (2004).)  Mazrui was, moreover, deeply dedicated to his
students.  One of the things he regretted most about his declining health was
the inability to meet his teaching responsibilities.  He was grateful to be
able to video-record an apology to his students.  He was so adored and revered
as a teacher and mentor that family and friends referred to him as “Mwalimu”
(Swahili for teacher). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Defining features of Mazrui’s intellectual
legacy include courage and controversy.  A principal theme of his work was to
identify and criticize abuses of political, economic and military power,
whether by colonial or imperial nations, including the United States, or by
leaders of developing countries, including African nations.  His original and
bold ideas generated passionate debate on African and Islamic issues. 
Expressing those ideas took professional and moral courage, especially when his
personal security was put at risk.  While he was still living in </p>

circulated essay entitled “When Spain </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Expelled the Jews and the Moors,” an unmistakable criticism
of Idi Amin’s expulsion of Ugandans of South Asian origin.  In fact, during
Mazrui’s tenure at Makerere, he gave several public lectures that criticized
Presidents Milton Obote and successor Idi Amin for violations of human rights
and the rule of law.  Additionally, while he was critical of Salman Rushdie’s
1988 novel, The Satanic Verses, Mazrui was one of the few famous Muslims to
publically oppose the Ayatollah Khomeini’s fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death. 
These public stances could have cost him his life.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Mazrui also risked his reputation, even when
not his life, by taking positions of principle that generated sharp criticism
and condemnation.  For example, his long-standing criticism of Israel (not
Judaism or Jewish people) for its treatment of Palestinians provoked some
pro-Israeli critics to challenge Mazrui’s character; label him (falsely) as
anti-Semitic; impersonate him as the author of hateful communiqués; subject him
to leaflets that used racial epithets while demanding the termination of his
employment; and shut down, through concerted e-mail traffic, the ability of his
institute to access the internet.  His argument in favor of nuclear
proliferation, whereby all countries could obtain nuclear weapons so long as
any country could, was denounced by some as irresponsible and dangerous.  He
insisted, however, that the most effective way to persuade the current members
of the “nuclear club” to agree to universal disarmament was to allow other
countries they did not control to pursue the power of nuclear threat.  His 1986
television series, The Africans: A Triple Heritage, won praise around the
world, including by members of the U.S. Congress in statements published in the
Congressional Record.  It also generated strong criticism, however, such as by
other members of Congress and by the head of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, who condemned the series as an “antiWestern diatribe” and withdrew
the agency’s name from the program’s credits.  Ironically, the series was also
banned for many years in Mazrui’s native country of Kenya, not for being too
anti-Western, but for being too anti-African.  Arthur Unger, a reporter for the
Christian Science Monitor, wrote during the airing of The Africans that when he
told Mazrui that he disagreed with many of his opinions but found the ideas
challenging, Mazrui replied, with a smile, “Good, … </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;

character and personal qualities.  His warmth was enveloping and his laughter
was infectious.  He was endlessly generous toward family, close and extended,
and to people in less fortunate circumstances.  He was gracious to all,
including strangers and intellectual adversaries.  The hospitality of Mazrui
and his beloved wife, Pauline, drew hundreds of visitors to their Vestal, New
York home from across town and the world.  He also kept in touch with
relatives, friends and colleagues in far off places with a personal newsletter
that he wrote annually for nearly forty years.  He enjoyed learning from people
from all walks of life and cultures.  An egalitarian and humanitarian, he
endeavored to treat all people with respect, dignity and fairness.  At the same
time, he valued spirited debate about political, economic and philosophical
ideas.  Mazrui modeled integrity and decency. </p>

daily news through print, radio and television, he especially enjoyed the radio

loved travelling the globe to speak to audiences of all kinds, enjoying meeting
people of different religions and ethnicities, sampling their cuisine, and
