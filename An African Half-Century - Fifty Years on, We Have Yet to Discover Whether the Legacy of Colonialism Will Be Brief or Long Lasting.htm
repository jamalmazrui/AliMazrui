<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This year 17 African countries
have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of independence – from the largest,
such as <u>Nigeria </u>and the former Belgian (now <u>Democratic Republic of)
Congo</u>, to the vulnerable, like <u>Niger </u>and <u>Somalia</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>But how deep was the impact of European colonialism? Was it
exceptional in its repercussions? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Or was the Eurocolonial century just a short chapter in
millennia of African history?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some African historians believe
that, despite its relative brevity, the impact of colonialism on Africa has
been of epic proportions, deep and wide-ranging. Others, though, argue that the
imperial period was often little more than an episode, its impact unjustifiably
exaggerated – one reason why European institutions transplanted to Africa have
not taken root. And only because our generation is so close to the era of
colonialism does its influence loom so large.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The shallowness of transplanted European institutions is
best illustrated in the Belgian Congo. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The so-called national army mutinied within little more
than a month of independence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The <u>richest province at the
time – Katanga </u>– declared its secession soon after. The <u>president,</u> <u>Josef
Kasavubu</u>, and the prime minister, <u>Patrice Lumumba</u>, declared each
other illegitimate, and before long the latter was assassinated. Since then
millions of people have died, and hundreds of thousands of women have been
raped. The Congo has remained the ultimate example of Africa's chronic
instability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The artificial boundaries of African colonies have made it
hard to integrate the populations into real nations. Sub-Saharan Africa
continues to be haunted by perennial ethnic rivalries, while Arab Africa has
suffered from periodic conflicts between Islam and secularism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Postcolonial African economies
have suffered from shortages of skills and an abundance of corruption. Three
codes of conduct (indigenous, Islamic and western) have created moral
incoherence, at least for the time being. Indeed, the Somali militants seem to
have traversed a whole span from pastoralism to piracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>On the other hand, the epic
school of imperial historiography would argue that European colonialism
prepared Africa for participation in global affairs. The continent has produced
two secretaries general of the United Nations (Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Kofi
Annan), and <u>a dozen</u> <u>Africans have won Nobel prizes</u>, predominantly
for peace, literature and physics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The epic school also celebrates
Africa's initiation into modern science and technology, the partial eradication
of deadly diseases, and enhanced infrastructure – in communications,
electrification and modern cities. Many of these changes are irreversible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But what are the signs for the
next 50 years of postcolonial Africa? Most of the continent is still in a
pre-democracy era, and many elections are notoriously rigged. However, most
African countries stand a good chance of becoming democratised. The real test
is when an incumbent president or political party allows itself to be
peacefully voted out of office – not once, but at least twice. <u>Ghana, which
led sub-Saharan Africa in the attainment of independence in 1957, has</u> <u>satisfied
that condition</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But there are countries that are
unlikely to be democratised before the end of this century. Particularly
vulnerable are dual societies, where two rival ethnic groups account for the
majority of the population – notably Burundi and Rwanda (with their Hutu/Tutsi
rivalry). Other states that may find democracy elusive are those that have a
long history of nomadic lifestyles, or of ordered anarchy, where governance
tends to rely more on consensus than on state coercion. And then there are
countries that were ordered tyrannies in pre-colonial times: Ethiopia, Egypt
and Libya had a history of indigenous dictatorship long before European
colonial rule. In the postcolonial era it is almost certain that their
centuries-old pharaonic and dynastic legacies will slow down democratisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:
13.65pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>And can Christianity and Islam, both growing in
influence across Africa, co-exist peacefully? In reality Christianity and Islam
are divisive in Africa if they reinforce prior linguistic and ethnic divisions.
Nigeria, for example, has the largest number of Muslims in Africa: almost all
its <u>Hausa </u>population are Muslims, almost all its <u>Igbo </u>are
Christians, and the <u>Yoruba </u>are split in the middle. Thus Islam
reinforces Hausa identity; Christianity reinforces Igbo identity; and Yoruba
nationalism unites its people regardless of religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Islam and Christianity divide
northern and southern Sudan mainly because the two regions were already divided
by even deeper pre-colonial cultural differences. On the other hand Senegal, a
90% Muslim country, repeatedly voted after independence for a <u>Christian
president</u>, and <u>his</u> <u>successor </u>had a Roman Catholic first lady.
This degree of ecumenical democracy has not been achieved in the west. And in
producing a female head of state, Africa has done something that has proved
beyond the United States, France and Russia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The years ahead in Africa will
likely be ones of continuing struggle, but we should ultimately discover if its
colonial transformation has been deep and epic, or merely shallow and episodic.</p>
