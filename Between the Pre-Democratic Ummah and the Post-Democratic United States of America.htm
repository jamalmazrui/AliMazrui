<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:28.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The countries of origin of most Muslim Americans are
pre-democratic. Those societies have yet to achieve the following basic
principles of democracy:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>If we apply the term
pre-democratic for a country like Pakistan, it is because we believe the
country has the capacity to evolve into a full fledge democracy in the years
ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>On the other hand, a country
which appears not to stand a chance of becoming a democratic system either this
century or in the foreseeable future may be described simply as “<i><u>undemocratic</u></i>”
rather than ”<i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>”. Afghanistan is undemocratic rather
than pre-democratic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Those Muslim countries which are
pre-democratic in our special sense are in that condition because of one or
more of the following impediments to democratisation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:54.7pt;text-indent:-27.0pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But while most Muslim countries
are either <i><u>undemocratic</u></i> or <i><u>predemocratic</u></i>, the
United States is becoming <i><u>post-democratic</u></i>. Of the three branches
of the American political system (the executive, the legislative and the
judiciary), only the executive branch has become more democratic in this 21st
century. The executive branch is now headed by a Black President </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>(something
inconceivable in the 20th century). Because the choice between Barrack Obama
and Hillary Clinton as s possible Democratic candidate was so close, the United
States gave signs that it was almost ready for a woman President (though long
after at least four Muslim countries had had women Prime Ministers or President
— Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, and Indonesia).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But while the executive branch of
the American system has made progress in democratisation in this 21st century,
the judiciary and the legislative are relapsing into negative post-democracy.
The judiciary’s behavior in the case of <i>Bush</i> vs. <i>Gore</i> in the year
2000 was worthy of a Third World corrupt Supreme Court. Five justices of the
U.S. Court subverted the system so that George W. Bush would win. The justices
were so conscious of the subversion that they themselves explicitly declared
their decision as <u>not</u> a precedent. This was post-democratic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Since then the Supreme Court of
the United States has negated decades of precedents which were legally
regulating the role of money in elections. The Supreme Court has now
legitimized a free-wheeling use of money by American corporations to influence
elections. This new additional empowerment of the rich is fundamentally
post-democratic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Miranda rights were supposed to
protect a suspect in the process of law enforcement. This Supreme Court has
diluted those rights in the year 2010 and increased the power of the police —
again, throwing out decades of established legal practice [“You have a right to
remain silent”]. This is another case of post-democratic deterioration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But it is not only the Judiciary
that has been democratically degenerating. The Congress of the United States is
more paralysed by partisanship than it has been for over one hundred years. The
requirement of sixty votes instead of a simple majority in the Senate has now
become applicable to almost every decision — instead of being a rare
occurrence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Studies indicate that since the
election of a Black President in the United States, polarisation between the
two political parties has reached paralyzing proportions reminiscent of America
in the nineteenth century. This is another measurement of a post-democratic
trend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:32.65pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>While the election of a Black President of the United
States has been a major step forward in the process of democratizing the U.S.
executive branch, the same election has worsened the democratic quality of the
legislature, paralyzing it further. And the U.S. judiciary is moving further
and further away from the old Warren Court standard of social justice.</p>

<h1>Democracy and Political Decay</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In a seminal article entitled
“Political Development and Political Decay” published in <i>World Politics</i>
(Princeton, NJ) in April 1965, the late Samuel Huntington argued that premature
political modernisation caused political decay rather than political
development. Premature modernisation included efforts to mobilize the
population at election time when the political institutions were still not
strong enough to sustain the disproportionate political participation.
Networking under the discipline of the clock has not always been efficient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Modern political institutions are
intended to maximize the accountability of the rulers and to optimize the
political involvement of the ruled. Postcolonial enthusiasm and charismatic
mobilisation put undue stress on weak institutions. Hence Huntington’s
conclusion that this kind of modernizing the political process resulted in
decay rather than development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Huntington was referring to
underdeveloped countries which were essentially (in my lexicon) pre-modern.
Development in their case was definable as capacity-building to sustain a
democratic order. Modernisation in their case was a quest for greater rationality,
greater technical efficiency, and a more knowledge-intensive political process.
In the context of Huntington’s model, a premature quest for either greater
rationality, greater efficiency, or greater knowledge-intensity could make it
more difficult to sustain the pursuit of a stable democracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Political decay in developing
societies occurs when the process of democratisation is stalled, interrupted or
even reversed. What Huntington never addressed in that seminal article was
whether a society which had already been democratic for generations if not
centuries could still be liable to political decay. Was democracy in advanced
countries reversible or subject to a serious relapse?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In our own article here we are
addressing the possibility of advanced countries becoming not only post-modern,
but also (in my lexicon) postdemocratic. Negative post-democracy is when an
advanced political system does indeed relapse normatively or decay institutionally.
Positive postdemocracy arrives when there are signs of innovative governance
superior in ethics and performance to liberal democracy as we have known it so
far. It could also be a new moral stride forward superior to social democracy,
indeed as we have known it so far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In his own influential article
entitled “The End of History” published in 1989, Francis Fukuyama argued that
the capitalist and democratic standards that the human race had already
achieved were, to all intents and purposes, the final stage of the whole history
of political economy. Those of us who rejected Fukuyama’s notion of the end of
history were in fact insisting that humanity’s capacity to innovate and even
reinvent itself should not be presumed to have dried up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Winston Churchill had argued that
democracy was “the worst form of government — except for all the others.” But
Winston Churchill did not know yet what “all the others” were. Nor are we as
yet knowledgeable as to what new and superior methods of human governance may
be around the corner in the march of global history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>What we do know already is that
fully mature and well established democracies are subject to relapses and even
potential reversals. Even if positive post-democracy (entailing an improved
social order) has not yet arrived, we know that negative post-democracy (a
declining ability to maintain modern democratic standards) is already at hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:32.65pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Political decay in developing countries is usually caused
by factors in the wider civil society — such as disproportionate networking and
political activism. But political decay in advanced countries is more often
caused by excesses of those in power — civilian or military — rather than by
civil society as a whole.</p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.15pt'>Ends and Means in Democracy</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Let us now examine more fully the
basics of modern democracy. Are the basics universal or culturally relative? It
would make sense for the Muslim world to distinguish between fundamental rights
and instrumental rights.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%'>1</span></sup>
The right to vote, for example, is an instrumental right designed to help us
achieve the fundamental right of government by consent. The right to a free
press is an instrumental right designed to help us achieve the open society and
freedom of information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>By the same token we can
distinguish in modern terms between democracy as means and democracy as goals.
The most fundamental of the goals of democracy are probably four in number. Let
us recapitulate. First, to make the rulers accountable and answerable for their
actions and policies. Secondly, to make the citizens effective participants in
choosing those rulers and in regulating their actions. Thirdly, to make the
society as open and the economy as transparent as possible; and fourthly to
make the social order fundamentally just and equitable to the greatest number
possible.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%'>2</span></sup>
This is not the democracy of ancient Greece, but is an approximation of
democracy married to modernity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Accountable rulers, actively
participating citizens, open society, transparent economy, and social justice —
those are the most fundamental ends of democracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>How to achieve these goals has
elicited different <u>means</u>. In making the rulers more accountable some
democracies (like the United States) have chosen separation of powers
(executive, legislative and judiciary), and checks and balances, while other
democracies (like the United Kingdom) have chosen the more concentrated notion
of sovereignty of parliament. These are different means towards making the
executive branch more accountable and answerable in its use of power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.3pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Is this democratic picture
still valid? Is it alive and well?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In May 2010 The British
Broadcasting Corporation had been doing a series of radio programs about
whether democracy was out of date. Was democracy a system of values and
institutions which had been overtaken by events?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The BBC involved me in the
project. I reflected on the fact that the 1970s witnessed an eruption of
publications on <i><u>post-modernism</u></i>. The spectacular rise of Barack
Obama raised the question of whether we had entered a <i><u>post-racial age</u></i>.
The BBC and I wondered together whether we had now entered the <i><u>post-democratic
age</u></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>As we mentioned earlier, current
democratic problems include the massive partisan polarisation in the United
States, often paralyzing Congress; the excesses of the Tea Party intolerance
and their denunciation of Barack Obama as Hitler and Stalin rolled into one;
Greece as the mother of democracy is now reduced to being the mother of
political extravagance and corruption, becoming the biggest of all threats to
the Euro; England as the mother of Parliaments now was reduced to a coalition
of opposites, Liberal Democrats and the Tories; Islamophobia has emerged as a
child of Western democratic populism; Switzerland has banned minarets in a
country which so far has a total of barely six minarets; France considers
outlawing the Muslim veil and the hijab because such anti-democratic measures
are nationally popular; the United States has come closer to tolerating torture
than at any time in the last one hundred years; the United States is more
comfortable with imprisoning suspects for years at Guantanamo Bay without access
to their own lawyers and often without hope of early release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Are all these factors part and
parcel of a <i><u>post-democratic</u></i> Western world? Indeed, the Supreme
Court of the United States, as we indicated,  is in danger of becoming a
post-democracy institution. The Supreme Court’s decision of the year 2000 in
favour of Bush and against Gore could have been made by a cynical Third World
Court. No wonder the Supreme Court was, as we referred earlier, embarrassed
enough to declare its decision as not constituting a legal precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The Supreme Court’s decision in
2010 allowing unlimited use of money by companies in elections is also (in our
lexicon) post-democratic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But while the Western world may
be drifting towards a <i><u>post-democracy</u> <u>era</u></i>, most of the
Muslim world, the Ummah, is still in a <i><u>pre-democracy</u></i> stage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Many Muslim elections are
notoriously rigged. Muslim losers in national elections are seldom gracious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:32.65pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>I personally believe that the majority of Muslim countries
— though still pre-democratic — stand a good chance of getting democratized.
Most recently Malaysia has led the Ummah in relatively successful
democratisation. But the real test is when an incumbent president, or an
incumbent political party, allows itself to be voted out of office — not once,
but at least twice. Turkey has met that requirement. Malaysia is still working
its way towards democratic inclusiveness in a plural society.</p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.1pt'>Democracy Resistant Countries</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But there are Muslim countries
which are unlikely to be democratized before the second half of this 21st
century, at the earliest, and more likely in the 22nd century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Particularly vulnerable are dual
societies — countries where two rival ethnic groups account for the majority of
the population. Such vulnerable countries include Iraq, which is ethnically
dual between Arab and Kurd, and religiously dual between the Sunni and the
Shi’a.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Another vulnerable category which
may find democracy elusive is a country which has a long history of a nomadic
lifestyle, and one which in precolonial times was a case of ordered anarchy. <i><u>Ordered
anarchy</u></i> is a form of governance which relies more on consensus than on
state coercion, and relies on rules rather than rulers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The best illustration of a
pre-colonial ordered anarchy is of course Somalia. A combination of
pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial factors have made Somalia the worst
case of a failed Muslim state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Another undemocratic category of
countries is almost the opposite of <i><u>ordered anarchy</u></i>. These are
countries which were already states in precolonial times, and were often cases
of <i><u>ordered tyranny</u></i> rather than <i><u>ordered</u> <u>anarchy</u></i>.
They may have been dictatorial for centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>African countries of today which
are mentioned by the same name in the Old Testament are Ethiopia, Egypt and
Libya — countries with a Biblical history of indigenous dictatorship long
before European colonial rule. In the post-colonial era it is almost certain
that the pharaohic legacy of Egypt, and the dynastic legacy of Ethiopia will
slow down the democratisation of these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Old
Testament states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>As for the relations between
Christianity and Islam in the Africa of today, both religions are expanding in
numbers, and growing in influence. But can they co-exist democratically and
peacefully? Nigeria is the largest concentration of Muslims in Africa — Nigeria
has more Muslims than Egypt.</p>

and Regional</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Let us now return to the
dialectic between dual and plural societies. In the new sociology of
underdevelopment. The real contrast to the <i><u>plural </u></i>society as a
threat to the state is the <i><u>dual</u></i> society. The plural society
endangers the state by having more sociological diversity than the political
process can accommodate. Paradoxically, the dual society endangers the state by
having less sociological differentiation than is needed for the politics of
compromise. Democracy is caught in-between. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>It is to this under-studied and
even unrecognized category of the dual society that we must now turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>As we grapple with new levels
identity disputes and ideological conflicts in the Muslim world, from Dacca to
Dakar, from Baghdad to Beirut, we ought to at least to try and identify which
socio-political situations are particularly conflict-prone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Quite a good deal of work has
been done on the plural society in the Third World — the type of society like
Malaysia and Pakistan, which have a multiplicity of ethnic and linguistic
groups and a plurality of political allegiances. What has yet to be explored
adequately is the phenomenon of <i><u>the</u> <u>dual society</u></i> — a
country whose fundamental divide is between two groups or two geographical
areas. The state in a dual society is vulnerable in a different way from the
state in a plural society. In a dual society two ethnic groups may account for
more than three quarters of the population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Algeria is a dual society. So is
the Sudan. But they are dual societies in very different senses. Algeria is an <i><u>ethnically</u></i>
dual society — whose potentially fatal cleavage is between the majority Arab
and the minority Berber. As we mentioned, Iraq is religiously dual between
Sunni and Shia, as well as linguistically dual between Arabs and Kurds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>However, Sudan is a <i><u>regionally</u></i>
dual society — divided between a more Arabised northern Sudan and a
Christian-led Southern Sudan. But although the Sudan is regionally dual, it is <i><u>ethnically</u></i>
plural. Both northern and southern Sudan are culturally diverse within
themselves. Indeed, Darfur is a miniature Dual Society within the north.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin:0in;text-align:left;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:200%'>Outside Africa, Cyprus is both regionally and ethnically
dual between Christian Greeks and Muslim Turks. There is a stalemate hovering
between partition and confederation, with the United Nations still trying to
mediate. Czechoslovakia was also both ethnically and regionally dual between
Czechs and Slovaks. In the post-communist era, the country has indeed
partitioned itself into separate Czech and Slovak Republics. In effect the
state of the old Czechoslovakia has collapsed and split into two. Was this
comparable to the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Bengali led East
Pakistan and the Urdu led West Pakistan between 1967 and 1971? The two halves
of old Pakistan collapsed long before Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The most risky situations are <i><u>not</u></i>
those involving a convergence of ethnic duality and regional (territorial)
duality, as in Cyprus or Czechoslovakia. It is true that when the two ethnic
groups are concentrated in separate regions, it increases the risk of
territorial or political separatism and secession. But, in human terms, that
may not be the worst scenario. This is still <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>, but
not fundamentally <i><u>undemocratic</u></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The most risky form of duality is
that of pure ethnic differentiation <i><u>without</u></i> territorial
differentiation. This can be dangerously undemocratic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>These would be
two groups physically intermingled. The religious intermingling of Sunni and
Shia in Iraq is one example. It means that there is no prospect of a Cyprus
stalemate, keeping the ethnic groups separate but peaceful. It also means that
there is no prospect of Czechoslovakia’s “gracious parting of the ways” —
creating separate countries. Rather, the two groups are so intermingled in
neighborhoods, at times so intermarried, (like Shia and Sunni in Iraq) that a
soured ethnic relationship is an explosive relationship. Such political dualism
can be more than a condition: it can be an agony. Can such a country be
democratized?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Although only minority Muslim,
Rwanda and Burundi fall into that category — ethnic duality without regional
duality. The two groups are intermingled from village to village, certainly
from street to street. Rwanda also happens to be the most densely populated
country on the African continent (estimated 210 persons per square kilometer
before the genocide in 1994 — or, about 540 persons per square mile). Can
Rwanda ever be truly democratized? Is it <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>? Or
fundamentally <i><u>undemocratic</u></i>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Ethnic duality without regional
separation can be a prescription for hate at close quarters. Algeria combines
Arab intermingling with some territorial Berber areas. Rwanda’s and Burundi’s
tragedies are a combination of ethnic duality, population density, geographic
intermingling and the legacies of colonial and pre-colonial relationships.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Northern Ireland is also a case
of ethnic duality (Protestant and Catholic) with considerable intermingling
within the north. There is no question of partitioning the north itself into a
Catholic sector to be united with the Irish Republic and a Protestant section
loyal to the United Kingdom. A second Irish partition is not in the cards, not
least because the population of the north is too geographically intermingled
for another partition. Intercommunal hate is therefore immediate and at close
range, in spite of hundreds of years of Irish liberalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Is Sri Lanka on the Indian Ocean
also a dual society, with the two biggest groups being the majority Sinhalese
and the minority Tamils? The population is intermingled to a substantial extent
— but the Tamil Tigers rebel group waged a long war for a separate Tamil
homeland in predominantly Tamil areas. Militarily the country faced a stalemate
until 2009. Has Sri Lanka now become democratizable?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Ethnically dual societies are
vulnerable to the risk of <i><u>polarisation</u></i>. This includes Nilotic and
Great Lakes countries in Eastern Africa. The absence of potential mediating
coalitions through other groups makes the Rwandas and Burundis of this world
more vulnerable than ever to periodic ethnic convulsions. These societies have
cultural frontiers without territorial frontiers — a dual identity within a
single country, a society at war with itself. Democratisation becomes more
elusive than ever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Sudan is also a country at war
with itself, but its duality is regional rather than ethnic. As we indicated,
both northern and southern Sudan are multi-ethnic, but the south is distinctive
by being culturally more indigenous, less Islamized, and led in the main by
Christianised Sudanese. There was a civil war between the two regions between
1955 and 1972, ending with the Addis Ababa accords of the latter year. In 1983
a second Sudanese civil war broke out, and raged for almost two more decades.
Both civil wars created hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced
persons. Underdevelopment was more deeply aggravated in terror and tears. More
recently there has been the more localized civil war in Darfur. There is also
the wider paradox that while the Sudanese South is more <i><u>Christianized</u></i>
than the North, the North is more <i><u>modernized</u></i> than the South — if
only infrastructually!</p>

line-height:107%'>The first Sudanese civil war (1955–1972) was more clearly
secessionist. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The Southern
rebels wanted to pull out of Sudan and form a separate country (the Bangladeshi
solution of outright secession). The second Sudanese civil war had been more
ambivalent about secession. Indeed, Southern military leader the late Colonel
John Garang had emphasized that he stood for a democratisation of the whole of
the Sudan rather than for southern secession. Now the South will have a choice
to secede or remain Sudanese early in 2011 in a referendum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>There may continue to be some
nation-wide intermingling between southerners and northerners even after
separation, but on a more modest scale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Muslims in Rwanda tried to remain
out of the 1994 conflict. Nevertheless, the speed of killing in Rwanda in April
and May 1994 was much faster than almost anything witnessed in the Sudanese
civil wars — some two hundred thousand people were killed in Rwanda within
barely a two-week period. “There are no devils left in Hell”, declared the
cover title to the May 1994 issue of the American newsmagazine’s <i><u>Time</u></i>,
“They are all in Rwanda.”<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%'>4</span></sup>
More were killed later. A third of the population of the country was subsequently
displaced or dislocated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Of course, the state has not
collapsed in Khartoum, though at times it has had no control over parts of the
south or the west. Secondly, unlike the Rwandan national army, the Khartoum
national army had not been seeking out helpless civilians for slaughter, from
refugee camps to hospitals. However, over the long run, both civil wars have
indeed been very costly in human lives and human suffering. The Sudan may be
about to find a solution to its violent dualism. Its split cultural personality
between north and south has so far been more divisive than its split ethic
personality among diverse “tribes” and clans. Is Sudan <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>?
Or is it hopelessly <i><u>undemocratic</u></i>? The answer hangs in the
balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The dual society continues to
cast its shadow over the Muslim World — from Lebanon (Shia versus Sunni) to
Algeria (Arab versus Berber), from Nigeria (north versus south) to the tensions
of Karachi and Khartoum. The sociology of underdevelopment continues to express
itself in a split personality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>While the Pakistan of 1947 was a
case of <i><u>both</u></i> ethnic and territorial dualism (<i>Bengali</i> vs. <i>Others</i>)
and Burundi as well as Rwanda are cases of ethnic dualism (<i>Tutsi</i> vs. <i>Hutu</i>)
without territorial dualism, Yemen has been a case of territorial dualism (<i>north</i>
vs. <i>south</i>) without significant ethnic dualism. Is the distinction
between the self-styled Republic of Somaliland and the rest of Somalia a case
of territorial dualism without ethnic dualism (as in the case of Yemen)? Or is
there sub-ethnic dualism between the two parts of <i><u>Somalia</u></i> which
make it more like the case of Cyprus (Greek-Cypriot versus Turkish-Cypriot),
both ethnically distinct and territorially differentiated? Alternatively the
two parts of Somalia may be an <i><u>intermediate </u></i>category of dualism,
equally prone to internecine conflict. The question continues to persist
whether such dual societies are truly democratisable. Somaliland may be <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>,
but the rest of Somalia is hopelessly <i><u>undemocratic</u></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The shadow of the United States
is cast over all these Muslim states — sometimes for the better, but often for
the worse. As America becomes more post-democratic, its international power may
become even more dangerous. The struggle continues between the largely
pre-democratic Ummah and the ominously post-democratic United States of
America.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>We have tried to demonstrate in
this paper that while most of approximately fifty Muslim countries in the world
are politically <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>, the United States is
deteriorating into a <i><u>post-democratic</u></i> condition. A Muslim country
is <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i> if it has never been a full democracy, but
stands a good chance of evolving into one. On the other hand, the United States
is drifting towards a <i><u>post-democratic</u></i> condition after generations
of relatively stable, even if flawed, democratic order.</p>

margin-bottom:13.3pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;text-indent:-.5pt;
line-height:107%'>But how can the United States be said to be democratically </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>deteriorating
when it has recently elected its first Black President, [Barack Obama] and came
nearer to having a woman presidential candidate of a major party [Hillary
Clinton] than at any time in history?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>This paper acknowledges that the
executive branch of the American system has become almost post-racial rather
than post-democratic. The election of Barack Obama to the U.S. Presidency was a
significant step forward in democratic inclusiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>On the other hand, the other two branches of American
government (the legislative and the judiciary) have become less and less
democratic. Congress is more paralysed today than it has been for more than a
hundred years. Partisanship is almost at an all-time high, and the filibuster
has almost totally replaced the principle of majority vote in the U.S. Senate.
The growth of the so-called Tea Party has introduced forms of fanaticism which
sometimes threaten armed revolution against the Obama administration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Political
candidates have openly threatened “Second Amendment Methods” [meaning “the use
of guns”] if they lose future elections. This rhetorical extremism has been
indirectly supported by the insensitivity of the current Supreme Court — which
has further legitimized possession of guns as a constitutional right — more
than ever before in the history of the Second Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The U.S. Supreme Court started to
become <i><u>post-democratic</u></i> with its decision in the case of <i>Bush</i>
vs. <i>Gore</i> in the presidential election of the year 2000. Five judges of
the Supreme Court cynically facilitated the victory of George W. Bush in an
interventionist manner unprecedented in U.S. judicial history. This was a major
step towards <i><u>post-democracy</u></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Since then this Supreme Court has
expanded the role of unrestrained corporate money in U.S. elections,
invalidated a number of other measures taken by the other two branches of
government, and more recently diluted its own Miranda rights [“you have a right
to remain silent”] for suspects when arrested by the police. The drift towards
a <i><u>post-democratic</u></i> conservative judicial standard seems
unrelenting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Although eligibility for being
elected to the U.S. Presidency has been de-racialized and heavily
de-genderized, what the Executive branch concretely does in actual policy
remains painfully <i><u>post-democratic</u></i>. Barack Obama has not closed
down the Guantanamo Gulag, nor has he released dozens of suspects who have been
languishing without trial for years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Again in spite of Obama’s
rhetoric there is reason to believe that torture is still occurring under U.S.
jurisdiction or with American complicity in third countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Obama’s use of unmanned flying
machines (drones) to bomb areas of Pakistan has become much worse than such
technological acts of terrorism perpetrated under George W. Bush. Dozens of
innocent people have been killed. This method of warfare has been entrusted to
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) rather than to the U.S. Armed Forces
directly. This unmanned covert warfare has not been subject to the democratic
oversight of any Congressional committee whatsoever. It is a form of an
unsupervised system of technological assassinations committed by the Obama
administration in a blood-letting form of post-democratic foreign policy. The
Obama Administration is indeed still fundamentally militaristic in foreign
policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The U.S. executive branch has
become democratic at the time of election but has continued to be tyrannical in
some of its actions in office after the election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>With regard to the countries
constituting the Muslim Ummah, a few are almost inherently <i><u>undemocratic</u></i>
rather than <i><u>pre-democratic</u></i>. The latter stand a chance of
self-democratisation; but the almost inherently undemocratic are unlikely to be
democratisable for at least another one hundred years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The different Muslim regimes
which are resistant to democratisation include those which are still
monarchical [e.g., Saudi Arabia], those which are under some kind of military
rule [e.g., Sudan, Libya and Syria], those which culturally come from a tradition
or little or no government [e.g., Somalia and Afghanistan], those which are as
old as the Biblical Old Testament and have had centuries of dictatorship [e.g.,
ex-pharaohic Egypt and post-dynastic   Ethiopia], and those which have been
experimenting with alternative models of democracy [e.g., Turkey and Malaysia].
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>All these have experienced
impediments to democratisation stemming from the history of governance in those
countries [pre-democratisation at the elite level]. But there are also societal
(rather than elite) obstacles to democratisation. In this paper we have paid
special attention to Muslim societies which are ethnically or linguistically
dual (Arab vs. Kurd), or religiously dual (Shia vs. Sunni, or Muslim vs.
Christian) and, thirdly, Muslim countries which are regionally dual (like East
and West Pakistan from 1947 to 1971; or North and South Sudan). These are
societal rather than elite impediments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Finally, this paper has
distinguished between <i><u>negative post-democracy</u> </i>(when a
long-established democracy tolerates more and more injustice, as the United
States has been doing) and <i><u>positive post-democracy</u></i> (when the
human mind at last succeeds in inventing a more ethical moral order than either
liberal democracy or social democracy).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>One scenario is a future
evolution of the best that <i><u>Islam</u></i> has to offer to the human
condition in terms of values, on one side, and, on the other side, the best
that <i><u>democracy</u></i> in the West and in the rest of the liberalized
world has demonstrated in terms of the ethics of politics and of public order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Perhaps much of the Muslim world
will succeed this century in evolving from <i><u>pre-democracy</u></i> to
full-fledged democratic standards. And perhaps the United States will put the
brakes on the drift towards <i><u>postdemocracy</u></i> — and return to its
historic role as a beacon of high expectations and wide democratic
inclusiveness.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
