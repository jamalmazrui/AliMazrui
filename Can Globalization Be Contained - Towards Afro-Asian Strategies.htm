<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.4pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>            Africa in this twenty first
century is likely to be one of the final battlegrounds of the forces of
globalization – for better or for worse.  This phenomenon called GLOBALIZATION
has its winners and losers.  In the initial phases, Africa has been among the
losers as it has been increasingly marginalized.  There are universities in the
United States which have more computers than the computers available in an
African country of twenty million people.  This has been the great <u>digital
divide</u>.  The distinction between the Haves and Have-nots has now coincided
with the distinction between <u>Digitised</u> and the “<u>Digi-prived</u>”.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>            Let
us begin with the challenge of a definition.  What is <u>globalization</u>?  It
consists of processes that lead toward global interdependence and the
increasing rapidity of exchange across vast distances.  The word <u>globalization</u>
is itself quite new, but the actual processes toward global interdependence and
exchange started centuries ago.              Four forces have been major
engines of globalization across time: religion, technology, economy, and
empire.  These have not necessarily acted separately, but often have reinforced
each other.  For example, the globalization of Christianity started with the
conversion of Emperor Constantine I of Rome in 313B.C.E..  The religious
conversion of an emperor started the process under which Christianity became
the dominant religion not only of Europe but also of many other societies later
ruled or settled by Europeans.  The globalization of Islam began not with
converting a readymade empire, but with building an empire almost from
scratch.  The Umayyads and Abbasids put together bits of other people’s empires
(e.g., former Byzantine Egypt and former Zoroastrian Persia) and created a
whole new civilization.  The forces of Christianity and Islam sometimes
clashed.  In Africa the two religions have competed for the soul of a
continent.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:175%'>            But
there are paradoxes of hope.  Senegal, overwhelmingly a Muslim country, had a
Roman Catholic President for twenty years (1960-1980).  When President Leopold
Sedar Senghor stepped down in 1980, he was succeeded by President Diouf, a
Muslim, but Diouf’s First Lady was a Roman Catholic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:175%'>            The
United Republic of Tanzania has been unique in a different way.  Tanzania has
had a religiously rotating Presidency – beginning with Roman Catholic President
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>Julius K.
Nyerere, succeeded by a Muslim Ali Hassan Mwinyi, followed by Christian
Benjamin Mkapa, and now once again succeeded by Muslim President Jakaya Mrisho
Kikwete. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:173%'>            Where
else but in Africa can such rotation occur at the highest level of government? 
Actually there is one other area of the world which has been prepared to
experiment with rotation at the pinnacle of power, though not as consistently
as Tanzania.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>India is the
nearest rival to Africa in religious rotation of power.  India’s current Prime
Minister, Manmohan Singh, is a Sikh – in spite of the fact that it was a Sikh
who assassinated a Hindu Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, in 1984.  In the past
India has also had a Muslim President – though the Presidency in India is
titular rather than an executive role.  India has also had an Italian-born Head
of the ruling party – Sonia Gandhi of the Congress Party.  It is conceivable
that Sonia Gandhi may one day agree to become the first European Prime Minister
of the Indian Republic – having seen across the world the first African
American with a Muslim father become President of the United States after a
heated election in 2008. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:173%'>            It
is one of the ironies of globalization that while it does consolidate the
preeminence of the Northern hemisphere in the global power equation,
globalization has also begun to open doors of reciprocal penetrations between
the North and the South. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:172%'>Voyages
of exploration were another major stage in the process of globalization.  Vasco
da Gama and Christopher Columbus opened up a whole new chapter in the history
of globalization.  Economy and empire were the major motives.  There followed
the migration of people.  The Portugese helped to build Fort Jesus in Mombasa,
Kenya.  The migration of the Pilgrim Fathers to America was in part a response
to religious and economic imperatives in Europe.  Demographic globalization
reached its height in the Americas with the influx of millions of people from
other hemispheres.  In time, the population of the United States became a
microcosm of the population of the world, for it contained immigrants from
almost every society on earth.  The making of America was the making of a
globalized society or universal nation.  Similarly, South Africa had Dutch
settlers three centuries ago – a potential universal nation on the African
continent was initiated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>            The
Industrial Revolution in Europe represents another major chapter in the history
of globalization.  This marriage between technology and economics resulted in
previously unknown levels of productivity.  Europe’s prosperity whetted its
appetite for new worlds to conquer.  The Atlantic slave trade was accelerated,
moving millions of Africans from one part of the world to another.  Europe’s
appetite also went imperial on a global scale, and one European people, the
British, built the largest and most far-flung colonial empire in human
experience, most of which lasted until after the end of World War II.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
9.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>            The two world wars were
themselves manifestations of globalization.  The twentieth century is the only
one to witness globalized warfare: during 1914-18 and again during 1939-45.  The
Cold War (1948-89) was yet another manifestation of globalization, for it was a
global power rivalry between two alliances: the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact.  While the two world wars were
militarily the most destructive, empirically the Cold War was potentially the
most dangerous, for it carried the seeds of planetary annihilation via nuclear
warfare.  At that time Africa was being courted by the Soviet bloc, by China as
well as by the West.  But China was a minor player.  However, China and India
are now emerging as newer global players.         The final historical stage of
globalization came when the Industrial Revolution was joined with the new
Information Revolution.  Interdependence and exchange became dramatically
dependent upon the computer.  The most powerful country by this time was the
United States.  <u>Pax Americana</u> mobilized three of globalization’s four
engines: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>technology,
economy, and empire.  Although in the second half of the twentieth century this
<u>Pax Americana</u> apparently did not seek to promote a particular religion,
it did help to promote secularism and the ideology of the separation of church
and state.  On balance, the impact of Americanization probably has been harmful
to religious values worldwide, whether intended or not.  Americanized Hindu
youth, Americanized Buddhist teenagers, or indeed Americanized Muslim
youngsters in Kenya or Nigeria are far less likely to be devout adherents of
their faiths than their non-Americanized counterparts.  The United States has
been a secularizing force in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:173%'>            In the new millennium the
forces of <u>globalization</u> are likely to continue, against the background
of the meaning of the twentieth century in world history.  As the twentieth
century came to a close, scholars interpreted globalization in three distinct
ways.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
9.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>These three prisms still classify
globalization in the following terms: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-20.0pt;line-height:
172%'><span style='line-height:172%'>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Forces which are transforming the global market and creating new

centrally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-20.0pt;line-height:
172%'><span style='line-height:172%'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Forces which are exploding into the information superhighway -
expanding access to data and mobilizing the computer and the Internet into
global service.  This tendency is marginalizing Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-20.0pt;line-height:
172%'><span style='line-height:172%'>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>All forces which are turning the world into a global village -
compressing distance, homogenizing culture, accelerating mobility, and reducing
the relevance of political borders.  Under this comprehensive definition,
globalization is the gradual villagization of the world.  These forces have
been at work in Africa long before the trans-Atlantic slave trade.           As
we have indicated, the twentieth century was the only century which had world
wars - 1914 to 1918, and 1939 to 1945.  This was the only century which created
world diplomatic institutions - the League of Nations and the United Nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:175%'>            This
was the only century which created a World Bank - the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) with the International Development </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:172%'>Association. 
The twentieth century also issued a Universal Declaration of Human Rights -
adopted by the United Nations in 1948.  This was the only century which
established a global university - the United Nations University in Tokyo,
Japan.  Some of these institutions have affected Africa more deeply than
others.  China was marginal for much of the second half of the twentieth
century.  Unfortunately these well intentioned organizations were not always
helpful to Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:173%'>            This
was the only century which had a world health institution - the World Health
Organization (WHO).  The twentieth century also created a global mechanism to
moderate trade relations - the World Trade Organization (WTO).  The Seattle
meeting of WTO at the end of the last millennium illustrated the depth of
feelings about the organization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:173%'>            This
was the only century which had a part-time global policeman - the United States
of America.  And, of course, this was the only century which developed a
genuine world economy - or at least a close approximation to it.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            All these were
indicators of globalization.  Although the term “globalization” is indeed new,
the forces which have been, as we indicated, creating it have been going on for
generations.  It is only now that we have realized that the forces at work have
had global repercussions and have been sometimes global in scale.  The creation
of the African Diaspora as a result of the African Slave trade turned out to be
another major manifestation of globalization.   </p>

<h1>Towards Taming Globalization<span style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:28.7pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            But is a globalized Planet Earth really a
global <u>village</u>?  The world may be <u>globalized</u> - but what would
make it <u>villagized</u>?  There is something missing - the compassion of the
village has yet to be globalized.  It is the cruelties of globalization which
create a need for arresting or containing the process.  What strategies are
available for post-colonial Africa and Asia to arrest, tame or contain
globalization?  It is to these strategies that we must now turn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The Southern
hemisphere especially has to strike a careful balance if it is not to be
marginalized by globalization.  In spite of all the foreign forces at work, and
perhaps because of that foreign intensity, the South (or Third World) must pay
special attention to the <u>strategy of indigenization</u>.  This includes
protecting major areas of indigenous culture, retooling indigenous skills for
use in modern contexts, and making sure that indigenous human and natural
resources are utilized in the optimum interest of the local people.   Another
approach that the South needs in order to save itself from the negative
consequences of globalization is the <u>strategy of domestication</u>.  This
involves making imported foreign institutions or imported technologies more
relevant to the needs of local populations and societies.  At the beginning of
the twentieth century indentured Indian labourers were used by the British Raj
to build a railway line from Mombasa in Kenya on the Indian Ocean to the great
Lake Victoria in otherwise landlocked Uganda.  Both the Indian labour and the
railway line were being exploited in the interest of the British Empire.  The
Indians had helped to build a key part of East Africa’s infrastructure – the
railway system.  But it took a while before the rail system was “domesticated”
in the sense of making it serve the interests of local populations rather than
primarily the British Empire.  It was like “domesticating” a wild elephant in
India to make it a beast of burden relevant to serving the interests of
Indians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Much later the
British built a university college in Kampala, Uganda (Makerere College).  In
concept, syllabus, purpose and design, Makerere was for a long time a foreign
institution.  It took decades to Africanize the syllabus, localize the
orientation, and “domesticate” the college. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            If and when Sonia
Gandhi becomes independent India’s first European Head of Government, would
that constitute the return of the Viceroy of India?  The Viceroy was of course
the white Governor-General who had once presided over India on behalf of the
British Raj. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            What would prevent
Sonia Gandhi from becoming a latter-day Viceroy is that she has indeed become
almost completely Indianized.  The British Viceroy had been a symbol of the
attempt to Westernize India.  Sonia Gandhi, on the other hand, has become an
embodiment of the Indianization of a Europe within the Indian Republic.  She
represents the process of “domestication” at a human level.  Is she part of the
globalization of India, or part of the Indianization of the European legacy in
South Asia?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
12.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Perhaps Sonia Gandhi represents
both those phenomena. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The third strategy of
containing the consequences of globalization is the <u>strategy</u> <u>of
diversification</u>.  The purpose is partly to ensure that globalization is not
just another name for, or another face of Westernization.  Africa must ensure
that it learns not just from Western culture, but also from the Indians, the
Japanese, from Muslim history, from Chinese economic and social experiments. 
In other words, globalization should really try to “go global” in its
diversified impact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            But Africa has needed
to diversify not merely its sources of foreign cultural influences, but also
its’ trading partners, its foreign-aid benefactors, the commodities it produces,
and the very foundations of its economies.  In addition, Africa has to learn
how to make the best use of the diversity it already possesses – including the
ethnic diversity of its indigenous populations and the racial diversity of its
immigrant communities.  Instead of treating its ‘tribal” and racial diversities
as problems to be resolved, Africa needs to see them as resources for Africa’s
enrichment and challenges for Africa’s creative response. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The fourth strategy
for taming globalization is <u>the strategy of horizontal</u> <u>interpenetration</u>. 
This involves cultivating partnerships with countries at approximately the same
level of development as that already attained by one’s own society.  For Africa
the first stage of horizontal interpenetration is the cultivation of greater
cooperation with other African countries.  The ambition is for better trade
relations, joint projects in developing such shared infrastructures as roads,
railways and hydroelectric dams, and greater Pan-African readiness to invest in
each other’s economies.  Regional integration among African states could
develop into not only enlargement of economic unions, but subsequently monetary
unions and eventually federal unification of African countries.        But
horizontal interpenetration for Africa should go beyond relations among </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>America.  The postcolonial phase
of Afro-Asian solidarity goes back at least to the Bandung Conference in 1955
which brought together a number of African and Asian countries to consolidate
an alliance against imperialism, colonialism, racism and the dangers of an
unfolding rivalry between the big powers.  The Cold War between the communist
world and the forces of capitalism had already led to the Korean War in the
early 1950s just a few years before the Bandung conference. </p>

Africa and Asia were of course centuries older than they were during the Cold
War of the second half of the twentieth century.  Particularly interesting were
the contacts and influences between India and Africa across the ages, as compared
with relations between China and Africa historically.  India has over time
become a soft power in Africa, influencing important areas of African cultures
and lifestyles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            India is more of a
cultural force in Africa than China is.  India’s civilization has exerted a
soft impact beyond its shores, creating a wider global cultural constituency. 
An obvious leverage emerges out of India as a power for global entertainment. 
The Indian film industry rivals Hollywood in production and in number of people
who view the movies.  Hollywood has a larger overseas constituency than India
does.  However, India has a much larger domestic constituency than Hollywood
does. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            There is no Chinese
equivalent of “Bollywood” – a movie-producing force from India whose products
are seen by people of vastly different cultures, from central Asia to Northern
Nigeria, from Eastern Africa to the West Indies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Then there is the
related influence of Indian popular music.  This amounts to more than the
popularity of Indian film songs.  There is also the impact of Indian musical
styles and rhythms on the music of other cultures and countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Sometimes it is
difficult to identify where the Indianization of African music ends and the
Africanization of Indian music begins.  A particularly striking example is the
Mombasa singer called <b>Juma Bhalo.  </b>This vocalist turns to Indian films

Gujerati.  There are also words which both Indian and African languages have

true that a variety of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Indian dishes have had a greater
impact on African cuisines than anything from China.  Samosas as a snack are on
the verge of getting universalized.  The <u>chapati </u>has become part of the
African cuisines in Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa – though what
Africans call “chapati” may be more like the Indian <u>paratha</u>.  Weddings
in Eastern Africa often have banquets of “biriani” or “pilau”.  The term
shish-kabob is disaggregated in African cuisines.  <i>Kababu</i> is one dish
made of minced meat, and mshakiki is an entirely separate snack made of larger
slices of roasted pierced meat.           Even in those African cuisines which
have been greatly influenced by the spiced styles of India, there are a lot of
other dishes which may be either indigenous or influenced by the Arabs.  But in
the context of our current comparison between India and China, the Indian
impact on African food culture has been much more extensive than China’s. </p>

Trinidad and Tobago in the West Indies the total populations are almost half

Indian music and even Indian languages have survived better in the Caribbean
than have either African musical styles or African languages.  Since the Indian
Diaspora in the Caribbean was more recent than the African, and since Indian
workers were imported as indentured labour rather than outright captives of
enslavement like the Africans, Indo-Guyanese and Indo-Trinidadians have saved
much more of their ancestaral culture than have their African compatriots saved
theirs.  Indeed, aspects of the Indian cuisine like <u>roti </u>and curry have

power must therefore be regarded as a fascinating aspect of horizontal interpenetration

reverse globalization, but it helps to diversify globalization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            More directly <u>political</u>
influences from India in recent history came when India became the vanguard of
anti-colonialism within the British Empire in the twentieth century.  Some of
the ideas of Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi became quite influential in the Black
world.  In South Africa Nobel Laureates for Peace, Albert Luthuli and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, combined Christian ideas and Gandhian principles in
their political worldviews.  Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Kenneth Kaunda of
Zambia were professed Gandhian disciples during the struggle for independence. 
They later became Presidents of their respective countries after independence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            In the United States
the most famous Gandhian in the civil rights movement was the Reverend Martin
Luther King Jr.  King’s Gandhism was publicly professed and implemented as a
strategy of passive resistance and nonviolence.  Ironically, Martin Luther King
Jr. was assassinated almost exactly twenty years after the assassination of
Mahatma Gandhi.  Both leaders have left behind great moral legacies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Gandhi’s impact on
Africa does qualify as horizonal interpenetration (SouthSouth).  However,
Gandhi’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the United States was more a
case of vertical counter-penetration (from South to North) to which we will
shortly turn for further examination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:18.9pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Horizontal interpenetration also includes
the whole diplomatic stance of <u>nonalignment</u> to which postcolonial India
was a major contributor.  In the middle of the Cold War (from the end of  World
War II to the late 1980s) almost all independent African countries claimed to
be nonaligned as between the Western bloc led by the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>United States and the Communist
bloc led by the Soviet Union.  India’s first Prime Minister after independence,
Jawaharlal Nehru, was one of the top leaders of the nonaligned movement until
his death in 1964. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The Cold War itself
was one of the political forces which fostered globalization, but nonalignment
in Third World countries helped those states to maintain a semblance of
diplomatic independence.  Nonalignment was mainly a South-South movement
encompassing postcolonial Asia, Africa and parts of Latin America.  The few
European members of the nonaligned movement were led by Yugoslavia under
Marshall Josip Broz Tito.  The nonaligned movement helped to tame competitive
ideological globalization fostered by the Cold War. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The People’s Republic
of China did regard itself as part of the Third World for much of the second
half of the twentieth century, and sometimes even professed to be nonaligned on
grounds that it was not a member of the Warsaw Pact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Mao’s China even had
ideological influence on some African nationalists and intellectuals.  But
while Gandhi’s influence in Africa was disproportionately in the struggle for
independence, Mao Tse Tung’s influence in Africa was disproportionately
postcolonial.  While Gandhi’s influence was a convergence of ethics and
politics, Mao’s influence was a convergence of revolutionary ideas and
politics.  Gandhi’s worldview was more clearly rooted in Indian culture; Mao
drew his inspiration not from Confucius but from Marx and Lenin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Gandhi’s ideas were
never banned even in British colonial Africa, whereas Mao’s books were actually
outlawed under such regimes as Jomo Kenyatta’s government in postcolonial
Kenya. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            In the struggle
against white minority rule in Southern Africa, the People’s Republic of China
could lend the hard power of weapons and not merely the soft-power of
ideology.  While India’s most distinctive contribution to Africa’s struggles
were passive resistance and nonviolence, the contribution of Mao’s China to
nationalists in Southern Africa were weapons of war and military training. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            In terms of
horizontal interpenetration China’s relationship with some of the nationalists
in Southern Africa at times came close to a military alliance.  The enemies
were Portuguese colonialism and white minority rule. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            China’s most
expensive foreign aid project was the building of the Railway Line between
Tanzania and Zambia (popularly known as TAZARA -- or Tanzania – Zambia
Railway).  The rail system was designed to give Zambia (which was landlocked)
an alternative route to the sea – avoiding both apartheid South Africa and
Portuguese-ruled Mozambique and Angola.  China also contributed to health
projects even in less hospitable Kenya, and expanded trade with countries like
Tanzania and Sudan.  India’s trade with Africa fluctuated but remained
significant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Both India and China
have also made efforts to contribute towards Africa’s higher education. Their
offering scholarships to African students to study in India and China started
before Africa’s independence.  Scholarships for India were not banned by the
colonial powers, but Chinese scholarships did not flourish until after
independence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            More recently India has
moved towards helping Africa close the digital divide.  India is not only
giving priority to African students seeking to study science and technology. 
India has also begun a scheme to help computerize Africa’s own educational
institutions at home.  On the one hand these technological trends are
themselves a contribution to globalization.  On the other hand, they reduce the
marginalizing consequences of more Eurocentric versions of globalization in
African societies.  The struggle to tame or contain globalization has its
paradoxes and contradictions.  China and India contribute towards further
globalization in Africa, but they also help to stem the tide of Westernization
and Eurocentrism in African societies. </p>

<h1 style='margin-right:2.95pt'>Towards Vertical Counter-penetration<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The fifth strategy
for taming globalization is the strategy of <u>counter-penetrating</u> <u>the
citadels of power.</u>  Since the days of European colonization of Africa and
Asia, Western power and values have penetrated non-Western societies.  The
strategy of counter-penetration reverses the direction of leverage and
influence.  Africa and Asia have been seeking to penetrate Western institutions
and attempt to exert counterinfluence.   Oil producing Third World countries
were among the first to acquire counterpower among their oil consuming Western
customers.  The Arab oil boycott of the United States and the Netherlands in
1973 was a particularly dramatic illustration of how the oil producing South
could punish the oil consuming North if the occasion required it.    China has
used more diverse forms of trade to counter-penetrate the Western world. 
Chinese textiles, toys, pet foods, calculating machines, video players have
penetrated American supermarkets in their millions.  The terms of trade between
the United States and China are heavily tilted in China’s favour.  As the
United States has gone deeper and deeper into debt, one of its principal
creditors has been the People’s Republic of China.  Many nationalistic and
protectionist Americans have become more and more resentful of China’s
counter-penetration into the American economy.         Here is another
contradiction of globalization.  Reciprocal economic dependence between China
and America is both an example of globalization and a trend towards reducing
the link between globalization and Westernization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            India’s
counter-penetration of the Western world is more complex, partly because the
population of India includes a huge English-speaking elite.  Technically highly
qualified Indians have found relatively easy access to the job markets of the
Western world.  Indian names and faces have become more and regular on American
television – with expertise which ranges from surgery to the world economy. 
South Asian Americans like Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Fareed Zakaria have hosted
television programs of their own every week. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            This is quite apart
from widespread South Asian researchers, professors, engineers, doctors, and
entrepreneurs.  Per head the Indians may be the most prosperous immigrant
minority in the United States. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            A more unusual form
of counter-penetration by Indians is the contribution of their skills without
migrating their people.  These are Indian skills used by American corporations
by remote control.  A customer may pick up the phone in Chicago to place an order
on an American firm.  The customer in Chicago may be speaking to a salesclerk
based in Mumbai, India.  Are American jobs being exported to South Asia?  At
election time this is often a bone of contention between protectionist
Americans and those who have reconciled themselves to the globalization of
labor.  India has counter-penetrated the United States both through the
migration of its qualified personnel and through the hiring of skills in India
to serve Westerners by remote control. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Demographic counter-penetration
by Africa into the United States can be traced back to the Atlantic
slave-trade.  The Diaspora of post-enslavement in the United States consists of
African Americans like Colin Powell, Condeleeza Rice, and Jesse Jackson, all of
them descended from the enslaved.  On the other hand, the Diaspora of
postcoloniality consists of Africans who have moved abroad as a result of the
disruptions and dislocations of the colonial experience in Africa.  Many
African engineers and professors currently working in the United States
constitute a post-colonial form of demographic counter-penetration. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Barack Obama is a
particularly spectacular manifestation of demographic counter-penetration.  The
son of a Kenyan father who studied in the United States long enough to produce
a son, Barack Obama is definitely not part of the Diaspora of postenslavement. 
He is not descended from the survivors of the Middle Passage (the transAtlantic
slave route). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            But is Obama a
product of the Diaspora of post-coloniality instead?  Since his mother was a
white American from Kansas, and his father returned to Kenya and died there,
Barack Obama is not fully a product of the Diaspora of post-coloniality
either.  It is perhaps the very ambiguity of his identity which helped him to attract
such large numbers of White, Black, Hispanic and indeed many South Asian
Americans to rally behind his presidential candidacy.  Obama’s multicultural
and ambivalent racial backgrounds turned out to be an electoral asset.  He was
born in multicultural Hawaii, had a Luo father from Kenya, an American mother
from Kansas, a step-father from Indonesia, a brief education in South East
Asia, a Muslim middle name, and a spectacular academic career at Columbia
University and from Harvard Law School.  Barack Obama is more than a case of
Africa’s counter-penetration into America’s citadel of power.  Obama is also
the only U.S. President who has ever been close to being <i>globalization
incarnate.</i>  The struggle continues. </p>

<h1>Conclusion<span style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            We have tried to demonstrate that both Africa
and Asia were caught up historically in a process of globalization which
extended over centuries, and which acquired a name only recently.  We described
the four engines of globalization as religion, empire, economy and technology. 
In the twentieth century the two World Wars and the Cold War became derivative
engines of globalization affecting not only the main antagonists in Europe, but
also the colonized peoples of European empires in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The literature of globalization
in the second half of the twentieth century focused on <u>economic
globalization</u> (enlargement of economic interdependencies across vast
distances), <u>informational globalization</u> (inclusive of the internet, the
computer revolution and the Information Superhighway) and <u>comprehensive
globalization</u> (all forms of integration and interdependency which have been
converting the world into a global village.  In this third sense globalization
becomes the villagization of the world.)    Are the forces of globalization
either reversible or irresistible?  Or can globalization be tamed or even
contained?  In this paper we have identified five strategies of globalization. 
The strategy of <u>indigenization</u> maximizes utilization of native skills,
talents, and the pursuit of the welfare of indigenous peoples.  The strategy of
<u>domestication</u> converts contributions from foreign sources into greater
relevance for local needs.  Gandhian techniques of resistance were
“domesticated” or Africanized to serve African anti-colonial struggles. 
Colonial universities established in Africa have gradually been “Africanized”
in syllabus, orientation, and purpose to become more relevant for Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The strategy of <u>diversification</u>
seeks to diversify not only trading partners and crops cultivated, but also
diversifying the cultures from which Africa should be prepared to learn. 
African societies should be more responsive to relevant models of development
from India, China, Japan and the Muslim world.        </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            The strategy of <u>horizontal
inter-penetration</u> would encourage not only partnerships among African
countries themselves (Pan-Africanism) but also Africa’s economic and diplomatic
alliances with India, China and the Arab world (including the nonaligned
movement and Afro-Asian solidarity). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            We have also drawn
attention to India’s historic soft power in Africa, manifested in comparative
music, cuisine, political ideas, and the impact of Indian films on the world of
entertainment in Africa.  In the twentieth century there was also the impact of
Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi on anti-colonialism in Africa and on the civil rights
movement, in the United States.  Jawaharlal Nehru’s India was also a vanguard
of the nonaligned movement when the big powers were divided between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.  Former African and Asian
colonies tried to avoid entanglement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            China’s influence in
Africa was less soft and less cultural than India’s – and more economic, more
revolutionary and more military than the impact of Nehru’s India.  Mao’s China
helped to provide weapons for Africa’s armed struggle, as well as Maoist ideas
of Leninist struggle.  Indian labourers at the beginning of the twentieth
century helped build a railway line between Kenya and Uganda under the auspices
of the British Raj.  Mao’s China in the second half of the twentieth century
helped to build a railway line between postcolonial Tanzania and postcolonial
Zambia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.0pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Both India and China have cultivated trade with
Africa.  In more recent years China has been particularly energetic in pursuing
African’s natural resources, especially petroleum in countries like Sudan.  On
the other hand, China has been reluctant to put pressure on Sudan about the
conflict in Darfur, or otherwise to interfere on issues of human rights and
civil liberties in countries with which China has trade relations.         As
for the strategy of <u>vertical counter-penetration</u>, this involves the
reverse flow of influence and leverage from the South to the Northern powers. 
China’s counterpenetration of the United States has tilted the balance in
trade, and made China a creditor to the United States.  India has
counter-penetrated America more with skills, partly aided by a shared English
language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Indians are becoming
more and more visible as part of the educational elite of the United States. 
And even from Mumbai Indians sell their skills to American corporations by
remote control. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
12.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            As for Africa, its demographic
counter-penetration goes back to the Atlantic slave trade.  There are now more
people of African descent in the United States than there are Jews in the whole
world added together.  Africans who have migrated more recently to the United
States have produced the Diaspora of post-coloniality, as contrasted by the </p>

multicultural background of Hawaii, Africa, Indonesia, Kansas, Muslim father
and grandfather, and Christian upbringing, have made Obama perhaps the only
Head of State worldwide who can be described as <u>globalization incarnate</u>
– hopefully in the spirit of optimism and human solidarity.  Amen.  <br
