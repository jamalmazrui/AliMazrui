subversive Zanzibar would be a threat to the mainland. He got the dictator of
Zanzibar at the time, Abeid Karume, to agree to a treaty of unionvery much
like the British used to convince African chiefs to accept treaties by which
they ceased to be sovereign. Nobody held a referendum in Zanzibar to check if
the people in the country wanted to cease being a separate independent nation.

the paramount questionare we facing birth-pangs or death-pangs in the present

decolonizationas the colonial structures within arbitrary borders are decaying
or collapsing? Is the post-Berlin colonial slate being washed clean with the

Islam duly adapted (by the West). </p>

caused great suffering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            To some medieval
Islamists there was Abode of <u>Ahd</u> and/or <u>Sulh</u>the home of
contractual co-existence in exchange for tribute. Tribute is what the Western
world has been receiving from most of the Third world in profits, interest on
the debt burden, and the returns on other forms of exploitation. And the United
Nations has sometimes unwittingly provided an umbrella for this tripartite
division of the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            But when all is said
and done, are there circumstances when the United Nations can be considered an <u>ally</u>
of Africa and the Muslim world? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            <u>First,</u> the UN
is an ally in the <u>humanitarian role</u> of the world body and its
agenciessuch as crises of refugees or international responses to famine,
draught and other catastrophes. In such roles it does not matter whether the
immediate beneficiaries are Muslims, as in Somalia and Bangladesh, or non-Muslims,
as in Rwanda. The UN is supportive of all such efforts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><u>Second</u>,
the United Nations is an ally when it provides an umbrella for mediation for
some of the quarrels <u>between</u> Muslims or between Africansas in the
effort to resolve the destiny of Western Sahara. The UN in such instances helps
Africa and the Ummah more directly. The UN helped in the quest for peace
between Iran and Iraq in their conflict in the 1980s.<sup>iv</sup> The UN has
helped Mozambique build peace more recently. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.1pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><u>Third</u>, the United Nations is an
ally to Muslims when the world body provides peacekeeping troops and
peacekeeping auspices in conflicts between Muslims and <u>nonMuslims</u> within
Africa or outside. Over the years United Nations troops have often been
involved in the often thankless task of trying to keep the peace between the
Arabs and the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Israelis especially prior to the Oslo

margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>example of attempted mediation between
Muslims and non-Muslims. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><u>Fourth</u>,
the United Nations is allied to Muslims when the Western world has been
divided! Africa and the Muslim world have sometimes had the UN move decisively
as an ally in such a situationas during the Suez war of 1956 when, in spite of
the veto by Britain  and France in the Security Council, the mood of the world
body was opposed to the invasion of Egypt by Britain, France and Israel. The
USA and USSR sometimes voted on the same side against Britain, France and
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>When the Western
world was divided, the United Nations was also able to play a major <u>decolonizing
role</u>. This is the <u>fifth</u> <u>positive</u> role of the UN. The United
States was historically opposed to some of the older varieties of European
imperialism. By the second half of the twentieth century the United States was
often on the same side as the Soviet Union among the critics of old-style
European colonialism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Under these
conditions it was indeed easier for the United Nations to become increasingly
one of the great arenas for the anti-colonial struggle waged by the peoples of
Asia, Africa and the scattered islands of the seas. The anti-colonial role of
the United Nations encompassed not only the Trusteeship Council but also the
General Assembly, especially from the late 1950s onwards. This anti-colonial
role was often a great service to Africa and the Muslim world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><u>Sixth</u>,
the United Nations can be an ally of the Muslim world when it takes seriously
the idea of prosecuting war criminals and those who have committed crimes
against humanity. Especially relevant for the Muslim world would be the
prosecution of war criminals in Bosnia and some Serbs in Serbia and many Serbs
in Bosnia who have committed crimes against humanity as in the current
proceedings at the Hague involving war crimes committed in Bosnia in the 1990s.
The UN Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, genocide in Rwanda and ethnic cleansing in
Darfur are also relevant. The United Nations has done well to appoint the
relevant tribunal for these tasks, but has fallen far short of providing the
resources for this complicated task. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.45pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><u>Seventh</u>, the United Nations has
been an ally when Africa and the Muslim world were united. It has at times been
possible to pass through the General Assembly highly contentious points of
principle. The state of Israel is based on an ideology which says that a Russian
who claims to be descended from Jews, and whose family has had no connection
with the Middle East for the last two thousand years, has more right to go and
settle in Israel than a Palestinian who ran away from Israel during the 1948
war. Was such discrimination racist? When Africans and Muslims were united in
1975, they managed to persuade the UN General Assembly to pass a resolution
affirming that Zionism was a form of racism. But when Africans and Muslims were
divided in 1991, that resolution was repealed by an overwhelming majority.<sup>v</sup>

issue of <u>women</u>; the one in Copenhagen on the issues of poverty and
development in 1994 and the one in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994 on the issue of <u>population</u>?
Africans and Muslims themselves are divided as to whether these UN
mega-conferences lead on to the erosion of their values or help Islamic and
African values find a new historic setting in the 20th and 21st centuries. For
example, are African and Muslim women being helped by new global standards of
gender equity which are promoted at these conferences?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>These
mega-conferences have of course been global and have been part of the United
Nations universalism of nation-states. Some tension has at times been created
with Islams universalism of faith. But it is a tension which can itself be
creative; it is a dialectic which can have a human face. At the very minimum,
Africa, Islam and the UN have one paramount interest in commonto ensure that <u>Dar
el Harb</u>, the Abode of War, shrinks further and further into the oblivion of
history, and Planet Earth becomes a House of Peace at long last. </p>

<h2 style='margin-right:.15pt'>CONCLUSION: From Mandelas Legacy to Obamas
Vision<span style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>More than a
century ago a conference opened in Berlin in 1884 to inaugurate the era of
competitive white imperialism in Africa. An election occurred in South Africa
in 1994 to end the era of white minority rule on the continent. One hundred and
ten years had elapsed since Otto von Bismarck had launched the European
scramble for Africa. What is the balance sheet of this chapter of African
historyfrom Bismarck playing host to the Berlin conference to Mandelas
election as President of post-apartheid South Africa? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.35pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            There are at least two standards of evaluation.
One is the standard of depth of impact of European colonization of Africa. How
fundamental are the changes which were triggered across the decades by Europes
penetration of African societies? Were these one hundred and ten years the
equivalent of a mere episode in millennia of Africas experience? This is the <u>episodic
</u>paradigm. Or did the era of European colonization of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Africa inaugurate the most far
reaching changes in Africas recorded history? This is the <u>epic</u>
paradigm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.8pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            The other standard of measuring the one hundred
and ten years is on the basis of cost-benefit. What repercussions of European
colonialism were beneficial for Africa and which ones were detrimental to
African interests? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Let us first return
to the standard of depth or shallowness of Europes impact on Africa before
evaluating whether the impact was helpful or harmful. There are in fact those
two schools of measuring Europes impact. We have referred to the <u>episodic</u>
interpretation, but the <u>epic school</u> would argue that the years 1884 to
1994 were not an ordinary century in Africas experience. Those years which
followed 18841885 unleashed unprecedented and wide-ranging changes in
Africachanges of immense implications for the peoples in the continent. Never
before Bismarck had any continent been subjected to such fundamental political,
economic, cultural and psychological influences as those transmitted by the
years 1884 to 1994. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            In this overview of the extended century since
Bismarck, we have paid special attention to what went wrong in Africa in the
aftermath of the European scramble for the continent. We have indeed implied
that the colonial changes were both negative and deep. However, on the issues
of security and governance we have argued that some of the adverse
repercussions of European penetration can indeed be reversed or corrected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            The continent which Bismarcks conference
partitioned and racialized has eventually produced historical figures
comparable to Bismarck in stature, but more positive in their impact on the
human condition. One such figure is Nelson Mandela who has contributed to the
deracialization of the African continent. The other is Barack </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Obama, who is redefining the racial
history of the world. SWAPO was in-between. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>             But in what
ways have Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama been cast by history </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>to help not only reverse the
partition of the African continent but also heal the division of the Black
world? Nelson Mandela is the most distinguished of the citizens of the African
continent. Barack Obama has become the most elevated of the citizens of the
African Diaspora. While in prison Mandela united the Black world through his
martyrdom. While campaigning Obama united the Black world through his ambition.
Mandela became globally famous because of decades of heroic suffering. Obama
became globally famous by the rapidity of political triumphs. Mandela made
history by refusing to be vanquished and by helping South Africa democratize
without racism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Obama made history by
insisting on being victorious. Mandela was part of the vanguard of the struggle
against racism in Africa. Obama was the ultimate beneficiary of the civil
rights movement in the United States. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            For twenty-seven
years while he was in detention Mandela was a role model for the Black world as
a whole because he stuck to his principles in the face of adversity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Nelson Mandela has been a role
model to Barack Obama, as well as to many others. There are signs that, like
Mandela, Barack Obama has learnt to stick to his principles in the face of
massive adversity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            In the context of global Africa as a whole the
torch has indeed been passed from an African warrior in his nineties to a Black
campaigner in his forties, from a former President in Africa to a new President
in America, from an old voice of unity still reverberating from Southern Africa
to a younger voice of redemption echoing in the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Diaspora. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Mandela is one of the
architects of a post-racism age. Obama is helping to foster a <u>post-racial</u>
condition. A world without racism is not necessarily a world without race
consciousness. Mandela is an abolitionist to end racism as prejudice; Obama
seeks to realize a world without race-consciousness as a demographic category. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            These are major steps
towards reversing the global repercussions of the Berlin conference of
18841885. But other ghosts of Bismarcks conference will continue to haunt
