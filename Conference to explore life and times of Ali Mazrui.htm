had ability to annoy diverse groups. With the British having cleared his path
to intellectual stardom, he initially pandered to Euro wishes. He had
deliberately tried to provoke Nkrumah with his “Leninist­Czar” article only for
Nkrumah to escape the trap by dismissing Mazrui as a tool of the white man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Prof Ali Mazrui was buried at Fort Jesus, Mombasa, in
October 2014, but he continues to excite people of ideas. This explains the
Twaweza Communications and SUNY­Binghamton symposium from July 14 to 17, at
Southern Sun in Parklands, Nairobi, on Mazrui’s impact. Although he achieved
his childhood dream of engaging in intellectual swordsmanship, a Cambridge
School Certificate almost derailed him. It stopped him from going to Makerere
University to train in the use of English language as a tool of verbal warfare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The derailment was temporary, though. Colonial connections,
and verbal wizardly, most likely rescued Mazrui from oblivion. His father, the
Chief Kadhi of colonial Kenya, and colonial Governor Philip Mitchell, shared
views on educating Muslim boys. Mitchell, an Oxford dropout, opened the Muslim
school and later gave Mazrui, dropped by Cambridge, a chance to improve his
English in England.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Mazrui flew from Nairobi to London along
with another beneficiary of British educational generosity, Bethwell</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Allan Ogot, a mathematics teacher at Alliance High
School&#894; Mazrui for pre­university polishing at Huddersfield College and
Ogot for a degree at Andrews University in Scotland. Both became prominent
scholars and taught at Makerere, Ogot in history and Mazrui in political
science.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:0in;line-height:142%'>Having received needed verbal warfare skills
from Manchester, Columbia, and Oxford, Mazrui entered Makerere from the top. He
then skyrocketed into the intellectual ozone layer, standing out above his
contemporaries. This reality will bring several intellectual giants to Nairobi
next week to re­examine Mazrui’s continuity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>POST­COLONIAL TEAM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What are they likely to examine? It will not be his naughty
childhood, his Mombasa escapades as a journalist and evening entertainer with
English wizardry, or his college antics in England and the United States. It
will be comparing, at two levels, his ability, despite Cambridge, to rise to
the top of the intellectual world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>There will be comparison with his
predecessors, intellectual giants of the past that include two North Africans,
St</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Augustine and Ibn Khaldun. Outside Africa, predecessors
would have Karl Marx, Immanuel Kant, Rene Descarte, Thomas Aquinas, John
Maynard Keynes, imperial propagandist Rudyard Kipling, and a Mazrui favourite
called Edmund Burke. Mazrui tried to ‘Africanise’ Burke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>There will be comparisons with his contemporaries, mostly
of the 20th century, divided between those of African descent and the others.
There are two African intellectual warriors groups — anti­colonial and
post­colonial. In the anti­colonial team are W.E.B. DuBois, Jomo Kenyatta,
Cheikh Anta Diop, and Aime Cesaire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Mazrui belonged to the post­colonial team along with Walter
Rodney, Wole Soyinka, Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, Frantz Fanon, Ngugi wa
Thiong’o, Claude Ake, and Samir Amin. Away from Africans, he compares with
Immanuel Wallenstein, Samuel Huntington, Hedley Bull, Raul Prebisch, Noam
Chomsky, Jurgen Habermas, and most important, Oxford­man Colin Leys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Leys systematically cleared the path for Mazrui’s unusual
academic ‘jumps’ in Makerere. Besides recruiting and leaving the
chairmanship/professorship to Mazrui, Leys capped path­clearing with his 1967
declaration that Mazrui was incapable of writing dull paragraphs. The issue,
however, was/is what came out of Mazrui’s pen which inspired, annoyed, and
aroused envy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Participants will note that Mazrui attracted admiration
with his wonder boy intellectual qualities. When they first met at Makerere,
Nyerere’s greeting was, “Tunasikia sifa tu!” Symposium participants will
reflect on Mazrui’s public debate with Uganda’s Chief of Security in 1969 on
the role of intellectuals in state building and be bemused by his 1970
encounter with the unassuming socialistic Walter Rodney at Makerere. Mazrui
received an intellectual whipping, took it in stride and mended fences with Rodney
when both were in the Americas. One of the master minds of that 1970
Rodney­Mazrui debate, Peter Anyang Nyong’o, is a participant at the symposium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>SOCIAL IDENTITY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Mazrui had ability to annoy diverse groups. With the
British having cleared his path to intellectual stardom, he initially pandered
to Euro wishes. He had deliberately tried to provoke Nkrumah with his
“Leninist­Czar” article only for Nkrumah to escape the trap by dismissing
Mazrui as a tool of the white man. Nyerere reacted to “Tanzaphilia” by denying
that he was an intellectual cannibal and was also angry at Mazrui for
questioning his Biafra position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Mazrui then re­engineered his social and intellectual
identity and turned into a Euro critic. This made Nkrumah and Nyerere mild
compared to the anger from Lynn Cheney, who had sponsored Mazrui’s The
Africans: Triple Heritage TV series.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Mazrui’s ability to spark envy is likely to feature in the
symposium. The envy was from those who wished their idols, or themselves, were
the ones receiving accolades. Prof William Ochieng, representing this category
of people, kept complaining that Mazrui was intellectually overrated, at the
expense of Ogot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>With these types of symposia, the world acknowledges
Mazrui’s place in intellectual history. In hosting it, Kenya accepts that he
was one of their best exports. The challenge is whether Kenya and African
states will produce others like Mazrui&#894; whether there will be continuity.</p>
