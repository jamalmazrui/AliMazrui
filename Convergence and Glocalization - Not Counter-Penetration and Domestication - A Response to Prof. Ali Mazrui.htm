margin-bottom:5.55pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'><b> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Prof. Ali Mazrui, the eminent
cultural anthropologist and historian, recalls the vibrant intellectual
environment that was present in East Africa in the early sixties in an article
titled, <i>Towards ReAfricanizing African Universities: Who Killed
Intellectualism in Post Colonial Era?</i> This era was characterized with
lively intellectual debates and the publication of regional intellectual
magazines like the <i>Transition</i> magazine which was based in Kampala and
the <i>East Africa Journal </i>which was based in Nairobi. Gradually, this
“African Revolution” died and the intellectual voices went to exile or fell
silent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Mazrui identifies “rising authoritarianism in
government and declining academic freedom on campuses” as the twin problems
that killed intellectualism in Kenya. In Tanzania, he identifies excessive
enthusiasm for socialism as an intimidating force against the opponents of
socialism and in Uganda, the brutal dictatorship of Idi Amin.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>In seeking ways of reviving intellectualism in
Africa, Mazrui begins by identifying the relationships universities should have
with the wider community. He states that universities should be “first;
politically distant from the state, second; culturally close to society and
third; intellectually linked to the wider scholarly world of learning.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Because African universities are modeled on western
paradigms, they suffer cultural and linguistic dependency. The result of this
is that whereas the universities have been able to reach the wider scholarly
world, they have ended up culturally alienating themselves from the African
society. Hence a contradiction arises between these two requirements. Cultural
proximity to global scholarship conflicts with cultural proximity to African
society. Because of this intellectual dependency, Mazrui argues, we have had
African graduates “despising their own ancestry” and being “intellectual
imitators and disciples of the West”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>He argues that the elimination of this paradigmatic
dependency and cultural alienation of African Universities is made difficult by
the fact that they have adopted European languages. Africa’s intellectual and
scientific dependency on the west, he maintains, is inseparable from linguistic
dependency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>After outlining the means by which African
universities ended up being “the highest transmitters” of western imperial
culture, Mazrui sets down to re-examining the agenda for reAfricanization and
he offers mechanisms by which the African university can be culturally
decolonized.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>He offers three strategies that can enable African
universities to “promote development in a post-colonial state without
consolidating the structures of dependency inherited from its imperial past”,
namely: domestication of modernity, the wider diversification of the cultural
content of modernity and counter-penetration of western civilization itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>This paper is a critical examination of these
strategies, their applicability in the current globalized environment and the
possible consequences of their implementation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Under the imperative of
domestication, Mazrui suggests means through which the African university can
Africanize itself and access and interact with the African society. These
strategies include making a pass in an African language a mandatory requirement
for admission to the university, making social and cultural anthropology an
integral part of secondary school education, effective utilization of oral
literature and introducing a specialization on oral traditions, hiring
specialists in indigenous herbs in faculties of medicine and studying sorcery
and witchcraft in rural Africa.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>He also suggests the adoption of different criteria
for faculty recruitment to enable absorption of “experts” on various spheres of
African culture into universities without a mandatory requirement of “a degree
from western or western-type educational institutions”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>What is African culture? Culture is
the “peculiar and distinctive ‘way of life’ of a group or class, the meanings,
values and ideas embodied in institutions, in social relations, in systems of
beliefs, in mores and customs, in uses of objects and material life” (Hall and
Jefferson, 1976, p.10-11).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>For more than a century, the African has been a
hybrid of western culture, courtesy of a colonial heritage, and traditional
African culture. The modern African wears Hugo Boss cologne, a Van Heusen
shirt, uses a Motorolla phone and a Dell computer. He only confronts a bit of
his African side when she visits rural Africa, where Toyota Ford cars are used
for transport and the folks are mostly Christian, Christianity being a western
religion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>For all intents and purposes, African traditional
culture only finds expression in some African communities during rites of
passage and some residual traces are still latent in taboo systems, which are
not visible. The underpinning culture in the African society is western. To
make the university a center for the perpetuation of African culture in such a
Western environment, where success is judged by western standards, and where
ninety-nine percent of books in University libraries are “western” would be incongruous
and misdirected.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Experts also indicate that it is counterproductive to
introduce a culture into an institution of learning, treating it like an
abstract academic concept. The American sociologist Talcott Persons observed
that “a cultural system does not institutionalize itself; it must be integrated
with a social environment that can fulfill the functional requirements for a
viable society” (Talcott Parsons, 1977, p.115). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin:0in;text-align:left;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:148%'>Culture is rooted in the community and within the
people. Its seedbed and habitat is in the lives and minds of the people. To
have it canned in a textbook and then presented in a classroom for consumption,
uprooted and unplugged from the society will abstract it and alienate it from
the society rather than integrate it within the society. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Mazrui’s suggestion of introducing African culture
into African universities runs into further problems because it treats the
“African culture” as a homogeneous, concrete collective. This is not the case.
In Kenya alone, there are over thirty tribes, each with its own set of cultural
beliefs and practices. In fact, the only unifying element across them is
western religion: Christianity, or Islam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>The strategy also implies that African culture and
beliefs are readily substitutable to western culture and beliefs. This is not
entirely incorrect. There are several important needs that western culture
satisfies in the African societies that have no viable alternatives in African
culture. For example, “western” medicine for curing Tuberculosis, Typhoid and
Meningitis have no traditional African medicinal cures. Western means of
transport also have no viable alternatives. In the area of beliefs, one only needs
to consider asking an African of the Christian persuasion to try entertaining
the gods of his or her ancestors. It demonstrates how far Africans have
wandered from the paths that their ancestors once treaded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>In areas where women have been unable to access
“western” sanitary pads, like the pastoralist societies, the girls miss school
during their menses and resort to unhygienic measures to deal with the flow.
What this means, ironically, is that anyone would be hard pressed to find a
crack in the face of the modern “African” society through which one can squeeze
in traditional African culture. Modern Africans are heavily westernized, more
so in the urban parts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>The content of western education systems are the
culmination of several intellectual revolutions over centuries, from the
Copernican revolution that saw heliocentricity replace geocentricity, to the
scientific revolution that saw the scientific method replace fideism and
western mysticism as a means of acquisition of knowledge. Thomas Kuhn’s <i>The</i>
<i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, captures the significant paradigm
shifts between various scientific epochs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>African traditional beliefs on the other hand,
flourished for centuries in the absence of any sound methodology for
falsification and verification of their propositions. They have retained all
the markings of profound ignorance about the way nature works. Western science,
which has taken man to the moon and enabled us to undertake heart transplants,
is immeasurably superior to African witchcraft which relies on mysticism and
dangerous trial-and-error techniques to seek remedy for illnesses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>We are at the cusp of the twenty-first century, with
a rigorous scientific method in place. It would be a sheer waste to dedicate
resources studying the “medical implications of sorcery and witchcraft” as
Prof. Mazrui suggests. These are beliefs and practices that have been tried and
tested. And they have been found to be lacking potency and solely sustained by
ignorance. To study these would be like studying the cosmological implications
of a flat earth theory. Even in the west, there are ideas that are bunk. But we
do not see western countries squandering resources trying to determine the
implications of, say, psychic experience. The same applies to African
witchcraft: it has no place in the classroom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Being a seasoned anthropologist, Prof
Mazrui must be aware that good anthropologists avoid being ethnocentric by
observing cultural relativity. “Relativism asserts that all people, all
cultures are equally good...it asserts that each culture must be valued on its
own terms” (Hammond, 1964, p.482). Cultural relativity keeps the anthropologist
from intruding upon his work by making subjective moral judgments on the
culture being studied.  Thus what matters is whether the culture satisfies the
people themselves. Because in the judgment of good versus bad, the good is
defined in terms of conditioning that each of us has had, in terms of our own
cultural values. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Because Prof. Mazrui is seeking ways of diluting the
influence of western culture in the African continent, the presumption is that
western culture is undesirable and African culture is good. Thus, he is arguing
from an ethnocentric position.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Ethnocentrism, in the form of Eurocentrism, is the
genesis of the pervasive cultural influence the Professor is trying to counter.
Questions abound about whether Mazrui’s ethnocentrism is acceptable because he
has suffered colonialism and imperialism. Mazrui omitted to provide an
explanation about why African culture is better. It appears that he is relying
on the appeal of tribal allegiance, rather than cogent reasons, to persuade
Africans to adopt the strategies he has proposed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Is African culture good for Africans?
How will our familiarity with oral traditions and African sorcery make us
better people? Presumably, Africans would be interested in them because of
their own heritage. But I am as interested in western tradition as much as I am
interested in African tradition. There is no African that chose to be an
African. Cultures must stand or fall based on their ability to better the lives
of people that adopt them, not based on the ethnicity of the people adopting
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>The presumption that African culture is good for
Africans is a myth. Ownership must not be confused with suitability. Roland
Barthes explains in <i>Mythologies </i>that myths are stories that societies
live by. They provide ways of conceptualizing and understanding the world and
are crucial to society’s efforts to construct and maintain a sense of
self-identity in the face of dominant groups. The ideological power of myth
derives from its capacity to transform history into nature. Barthes notes that
“myth has an imperative, buttonholing character: stemming from an historical
concept, directly springing from contingency.” Thus a cogent case for the value
of African culture to Africans is required and we have to be vigilant because
the myth that African culture is good for Africans summons us to receive its
expansive ambiguity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>While I am aware that anthropologists like Justin Lee
have argued, with good reason, that Universal declaration of human rights “is
not universal at all but rather should be called western human rights” (Justin
Lee, 1997), such arguments do not detract the fact that western culture entails
recognition of human rights, a component that is given little consideration in
African traditions and culture. Presently, several campaigns are ongoing in
Kenya to save young girls from early marriages and from the practice of female
genital mutilation. Some African communities believe that violation of taboos
causes illness and death. This has perpetuated the spread of AIDS. These are
just some examples that indicate the inherent weaknesses of mystical African
culture and traditions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>It is unclear exactly what Mazrui believes a
“specialization on oral traditions” can achieve. But suffice it to say that
oral traditions were used by primitive tribes that had not yet mastered the art
of writing. Specializing in them and teaching people to master them is like
specializing and teaching people in the use of Stone Age tools in an
information age.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Kenyan secondary school curricula are overloaded as
it is. In fact, to ease this overload, students are allowed to drop one science
subject or one humanity subject. This does not mean that social and cultural
anthropology cannot be made an integral part of the curriculum. It means that
it must be done carefully; whilst aware that it could probably make the spine
of our curriculum snap under the extra weight.  </p>

.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Instead of the domestication
strategy, which seeks to perpetuate African traditions without clear reasons;
Africans instead ought to consider the glocalization strategy instead. In <i>The
World is Flat</i>, Thomas Friedman argues that in order to cope in our
globalized world, nations must sacrifice a degree of economic sovereignty to
global institutions in order to achieve western-style economic success. But at
the same time, a country must preserve its local traditions while it
globalizes. Friedman describes this process as “glocalization”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>The difference between glocalizing and domesticating
is that glocalizing leaves the arena for the preservation of local traditions
out of the educational institutions. We know the problems with domestication
and I demonstrate further below that we live in an increasingly western world
each passing day. Evolutionary science informs us that when the fitness
landscape is altered, the individuals that cannot adapt perish. Adaptation, not
sameness will be the key to our survival and ultimate success. Africa cannot
grow without changing. Alterity is the byword, not rigidity. Meshing in and
interpenetrating is the way, not standing out.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>A functionalist approach would be the most effective
way of going about determining which traditions to preserve and which ones to
discard as one goes about glocalizing. Traditions that serve no function, like
superstitious beliefs and female genital mutilation, should be discarded. And
aspects of western culture that can better our lives, like communication
technology, should be fully embraced. This will bring about a confluence of
cultures that will see the maturity of a hybrid, heterogeneous culture, instead
of having isolated pillars of African culture soaking in a sea of western
culture.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:

.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Under this strategy, Mazrui proposes
that the cultural content of modernity be diversified because it is safer to
depend on many countries than upon one country. This would transform the
universities from “a multinational corporation to a multicultural corporation”.
He suggests studying Chinese, Indian and Islamic civilizations alongside the
introduction of the history of science in African secondary schools. He laments
that western leadership in science and technology has led people to regard
westernism as interchangeable with science.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Mazrui notes that African reactions to western
pre-eminence of science in the past included negritude, which was led by
Leopold Senghor, and Marxist ideology. He suggests that African students be
taught how the west found intellectual and scientific benefactors from
different civilizations over the centuries including the Egyptian, Chinese and
Islamic civilizations. The awareness brought about by such instruction, he
argues, would “reveal the diversity of the human heritage, and break the
dangerous myth of Western scientific preeminence” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Since access to a culture is largely facilitated by
knowledge of its language, Mazrui suggests that “Each African child should
learn a minimum of three languages – one European, one Asian and one African.”
He lastly suggests a departure from “excessive Eurocentrism and toward a
paradoxical combination of increased Africanization and increased
internationalization of each department programme.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>As noted earlier, the African society is a hybrid of
several societies. Kenyans for example, drive Japanese Toyotas, wear American
clothes, and learn under a British system of education. As such, they do not
depend on one country culturally or ideologically. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Being a technological dimension of culture, language
provides the learner with an understanding of a different culture and different
reality whilst deepening ones knowledge about a culture. Kenyan secondary
schools almost all have instructions in three languages. Typically, there is
Swahili, English and an additional European language like French or German.
Where they fail to meet Prof. Mazrui’s diversification imperative is the lack
of an Asian language. How significant on our development efforts is our failure
to learn an Asian language? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>To answer that question, let us
consider India: a nuclear superpower and the second most populous nation. India
is among the fastest growing economies in the last decade in spite of the fact
that in higher levels of learning in that country, English is the language of
instruction that is used. That means they are facing the same situation Kenyans
are facing, with Swahili being dropped at the University level except for those
studying linguistics. Yet this has not impeded Indians from developing technologically,
to the extent that the west needs them. American multinationals are
increasingly opening subsidiaries in India and off shoring jobs that cost
billions of dollars to India. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Prof. Mazrui’s suggestion that a third Asian language
be added to the curriculum appears incognizant of the fact that in almost all
Asian countries, with the exception of Japan and China, instructions in high
levels of education are conducted in English. Are Indians, with their caste
system and Hindu religion, culturally dependent on the west? Hardly. The Indian
example demonstrates that whatever problems may be facing African, cultural
dependence on the west is not a significant one. In fact, the west has saved
Africans the trouble of having to re-invent the wheel by sharing with Africans
the final products of the renaissance, the enlightenment and other cultural
revolutions in form of educational content.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>What Africans need to do, in the humble view of this
author, is not to introduce a competing culture, but to surpass western
intellects in the mastery of western science and outinnovate them as the world
gets “flatter”, to use an expression coined by Thomas Friedman. Asian countries
do not teach Swahili, Wolof or other African languages. Why? We need to ask
ourselves these questions even as we consider teaching Asian languages in our
schools. What economic or cultural gain can Kenyans for example acquire by
learning Hindi in the increasingly highly westernized society?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Christianity is taught alongside Islam, Buddhism and
other religions in schools. Christianity has only won more converts because of
Christian missionization. Islam is a religion and cannot be juxtaposed with
Chinese and Hindu cultures as Mazrui does. Kenya, for example, is a secular
state and it would be unconstitutional for the government to be behind an
initiative to promote the teaching Islam in the Universities in the name of
“diversification of cultural content”. </p>

equation of westernism with science and lack of awareness regarding the fact
that the west had “intellectual and scientific benefactors from different
civilizations over the centuries”, we first need to understand what westernism
is before we can address his concern properly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Westernism refers to a characteristic of people in
the occident. The occident, as opposed to the orient, refers to the European
and American Nations. It is true that the west had benefactors from different
civilizations, but most of these benefactors mostly contributed, not in science
<i>per se</i>, but in related fields like mathematics and philosophy. The
Egyptians taught Pythagoras, who is credited with the discovery of the
numerical ratios and western science employs Arabic numbering system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>But the west took off when they developed the
scientific method. And that is what set them apart from their benefactors.
Turning points like the enlightenment and the renaissance culminated in the
west’s acceptance of positivism in place of metaphysics. Positivist philosophy,
per Auguste Comte in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, held that the only authentic
knowledge is scientific knowledge. The history of science informs us that all
the major contributors to the development of the scientific enterprise, from
Henri Poincarre, Larry Laudan, Karl Popper and Bertrand Russel, were
westerners. And it is upon the adoption of the scientific method as the
authoritative source of knowledge that the west started making phenomenal
progress. Great progress in science was made from the First World War onwards.
The 20<sup>th</sup> century saw a steady increase in the publication of
scientific journals. And to date, more than ninety per cent of them are
western. This alone has forced the rest of the world to learn English in order
to access the works of the best minds in science. Nobel prizes for science are
almost all bagged by westerners. Thus contrary to Prof. Mazrui’s contention
that it is incorrect to equate westernism with science, we see that modern
science is a western phenomenon. In fact, science is a <i>sine qua non</i> of
Occidentalism. </p>

culture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:

counter-penetration in Jazz and through workmanship and the importation of
African slaves into the New World. Mazrui argues that to balance the asymmetry
of the reciprocal cultural penetration between Africa and the west, Africa will
need allies and they consist of the Arab world and the black Diaspora (chiefly
black Americans). Because Arabs share a continent with black people and have
already started a strategy of counter-penetrating the west through economic maneuvers,
they present an attractive ally, he observes. He also sees OPEC as a viable

difficulties. </p>

niche in the global market and developing competitive strength in it. That
niche can be in any area and Africans must find it, whether collectively or by
country. It may not be technological know-how because India University
education is very accessible to Indians and is more than twice as cheaper as
education in Africa and at a population of 1.2 billion, Africa, with a meager
770 million has a long way to go before it can come close to India. But that does
not detract from the idea that high levels of literacy is a fundamental
starting point in our development, not Africanization agenda. Africans must
seek ways of reaping maximal benefits from western education through mastering
it, harnessing it and making it accessible to more Africans. </p>

assumptions regarding African culture may need revision because his strategies
appear to underestimate the extent of the penetration of western culture in the
current African society and the degree of cultural mutation the African has
undergone since his colonial masters abandoned her. It will be difficult to
isolate the hybridized individual that is the modern African, from his western
environment to allow a clear treatment of his African heritage, separate from
