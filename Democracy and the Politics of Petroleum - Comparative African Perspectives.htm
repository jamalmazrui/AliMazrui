Goddy Jidenma Foundation scheduled for delivery at the Nigerian Institute for
International Affairs, Lagos, Nigeria, December 8, 2011. This lecture is
indebted to earlier works on Nigeria by the author, including <i>A Tale of Two
Africas: Nigeria and South Africa as Contrasting Visions</i> (London: Adonis
&amp; Abbey Publishers, 2006). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Does a resource rich African country find it easier or more
difficult to stabilize democracy? Nigeria has of course been an oil-rich
country throughout its life as an independent country. Has Nigeria’s oil wealth
helped or hindered its efforts to democratize? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            We plan to demonstrate that if the natural
resources are discovered after democracy has started maturing, the new wealth
would help stabilize the democracy. But if the mineral wealth comes <u>before</u>
democratization, it could delay the democratizing process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            A positive example outside Africa is the
discovery of oil resources in the waters of Norway and Scotland. This was a
case of economic enrichment of already mature democracies. In the case of
Norway the oil has strengthened the welfare state and stabilized democratic
governance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            In the case of Scotland petroleum initially
deepened Scottish nationalism and aggravated separatist sentiment for awhile.
But the longer term consequences have given Scotland a regional legislature and
more solid influence within the United Kingdom. The arrival of economic
enrichment after substantial democratization has stabilized the democratic
order in both Norway and Scotland.   With a developing country like Nigeria, on
the other hand, the petro-wealth preceded stable democratization. The country
became independent with three huge provinces of a federation which were
inherently unsustainable for long. The oil wealth was mainly in the Eastern
region. The debatable point was whether the petro-wealth contributed to the
level of self-confidence of Eastern Nigeria. Did </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>this trigger the Eastern led military coup of January 1966?
Did the East seek to control more effectively the petroleum located on their
own region? And when Eastern Nigerians later became victims of the Northern
counter-coup, and the genocidal anti-Igbo massacres, did the petroleum in the
East strengthen the late Ojukwu’s resolve to attempt secession from Nigeria?
Pre-democratic petro-wealth had created impediments to Nigeria’s democratic
progress.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Another African example of natural wealth
before national democratization was the former Belgian Congo upon attaining
independence in 1960. Eastern Congo at the time was almost as well-endowed as
Eastern Nigeria — but the Congo had Katanga minerals rather than petroleum.
Just as oil-wealth later triggered separation and attempted secession in
Eastern Nigeria, copper and other mineral wealth inspired Moise Tshombe to
attempt the secession of Katanga from former Belgian Congo. In the second half
of the twentieth century both Nigeria and Congo Kinshasa illustrated the
proposition that natural resources before the stabilization of democracy was
likely to militate against further democratization.      On the other hand, the
Republic of South Africa had <u>selective</u> democracy for white people a
century and a half before extending the full franchise to black people and
other South Africans of colour. Whites had free and fair elections for
themselves but not for the rest of the population. The country had a working parliamentary
system, and a judiciary which had relative independence within the constraints
of a racial political order. Even at the height of apartheid South Africa was
acquiring democratically relevant experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Did the fact that South Africa had a racially
selective democracy, <u>alongside</u> <u>prior mineral wealth</u>, help post-apartheid
South Africa to enhance its democratic order? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            While the Congo had seen its democracy collapse
within a year of attaining independence, and Nigeria had a military coup in
less than six years of attaining sovereign status, South Africa continues to
have the most liberal constitution in Africa’s entire history nearly two
decades after the end of apartheid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Post-apartheid South Africa had not only
extended the franchise to citizens of colour, but had also abolished the death
penalty, enhanced Press freedom, freely elected three different presidents
since 1994, recognized gay rights, and legalized same-sex marriage and civil
unions. Even selective democracy, combined with simultaneous mineral wealth,
provided subsequent opportunities for further democratization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            However, all three well-endowed countries
(Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of South
Africa) had to confront a shared threat to democracy — the threat of
plutocracy. Substantial mineral and petrowealth in these three countries
created potential rivalry between rule by the wealthy and rule by the people.
Let us turn to these dilemmas more fully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;

vs. Plutocracy?</u> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Oil-rich Third World countries are indeed
caught between the reality of plutocracy (rule by the rich) and the aspiration
towards democracy (rule by the people). The wealth of petroleum creates great
disparities in income and major differences in economic power. On the other
hand, the population as a whole can become restless for a greater say in how
the wealth of the nation is distributed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In addition to the choice between
plutocracy (the power of wealth) and democracy (the power of votes) Nigeria was
for awhile disrupted by militocracy (the power of soldiers and the military).
Indeed, during much of the second half of the twentieth century, Nigeria was
controlled more by soldiers than by either the economically rich or by people’s
power. Nevertheless, the country’s petro-wealth created additional motivation
for the military to control the economy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Here it is worth distinguishing between <i>coup-prone</i>
African countries like the Congo (Kinshasa) and Nigeria from the mid-1960s to
the end of the twentieth century, and <i>coup-proof</i> African states which
have never experienced military governments since independence. <i>Coup-proof</i>
African states include South Africa, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:13.65pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Ghana also used to be coup-prone. In this
twenty-first century Ghana has become less <i>coup-prone </i>by demonstrating
how an incumbent ruling party can be outvoted and be peacefully replaced. When
such a change occurs though the ballot box more than once (as it has in Ghana)
the prospects of becoming a <i>coup-proof </i>country improve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In the case of Nigeria and the Congo this
twenty first century seems to have made those two states less and less <i>coup-prone</i>
but unfortunately more and more <i>conflict-prone. </i>The Niger-Delta has been
repeatedly disrupted by conflict and terrorism. And the tensions between
Christians and Muslims have often exploded into violence — including terrorism
against such foreigners, as United Nations personnel. In the former Belgian Congo
a succession of civil wars has killed millions of Congolese. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In addition to plutocracy, democracy and
militocracy, Nigeria has been struggling with meritocracy (rule by the learned
and the skilled). Independent </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:13.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Nigeria’s first Head of State was Nnamdi
Azikiwe (popularly known as Zik). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Azikiwe was not a philosopher-King, but he was arguably a
philosopher President. I met Zik at Lincoln Un8iversity in Pennsylvania where I
was one of the speakers in his honor in the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. His particular leadership was interpreted as a sign that Nigeria would
develop into a meritocratic system of government — with leadership coming
disproportionately from the educated class. This was in contrast to the Congo
which in 1960 had only a handful of college graduates. Unfortunately the military
coup in Lagos in January 1966 interrupted the merit-symphony in Nigeria.
Instead a whole generation of militocracy (rule by the military) was
inaugurated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Ironically, the Nigerian civil war
(1967–1970) reactivated elements of meritocracy within the separatist Eastern
Region (Biafra). The Igbo had revealed technological skills in the second half
of the twentieth century. Indeed, their triumphant economic skills in Northern
Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s contributed to their vulnerability as a people
in 1966. For a while Eastern Nigeria was well-endowed in education as well as
in petroleum. The East was both skill- intensive and resource-intensive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>During the Nigerian Civil War
innovativeness among the Igbo produced Africa’s first-locally-made
gun-vehicles. During that Biafran conflict the Igbo displayed levels of
innovation which were unprecedented in post colonial African history. The Igbo
created rough-and-ready armed militarized vehicles as well as the beginnings of
Africa’s industrial revolution. This renaissance was aborted by the oil bonanza
from 1997 onwards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Although warfare is inherently
destructive, it also often releases inventiveness. During the Biafra war
Nigeria was more internally innovative than externally prosperous. The Nigerian
Civil War produced some of the <u>high</u> points of Nigeria’s experience with
technological innovation. Meritocracy manifested itself. However, the Nigerian
oil bonanza after the 1973 OPEC price escalation created <u>disincentives</u>
to Nigerian enterprise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>War had indeed brought out both the best
and the worst of Nigeria in human terms. But <i>technologically</i> the power
of spilt blood in Nigeria produced greater innovation than the power of
sprouting petroleum. The pain of Biafra was technologically more fruitful than
the profit of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries [OPEC].
However, democracy continued to be elusive in the last quarter of the 20th
century. </p>

that a small country can be a player on the world stage, and not merely a pawn
in the hands of the Big Powers. Over the decades Gaddafi was involved in such
international conflicts as supporting the Irish Republican Army, funding the
Palestinians, financing Muslim rebels in the Philippines, subsidizing Louis
Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam in America, and trying to defend Idi Amin from
both his domestic and international adversaries. </p>

Unity (O.A.U.) and some of the projects of Afro-Arab solidarity under UNESCO in
Paris, France.   He also allowed citizens of some neighbouring sub-Saharan
African countries to find varied kinds of jobs in Libya. He invested in development
projects in such countries as Mali, Niger and even Kenya. Gaddafi’s Libya owned
multiple hotels in other African countries. </p>

economies of the world are bound to be significantly affected by the computer

in their responsiveness to the computer and the internet. Indeed, while some

calculus-challenged (ill-at-ease with mathematics). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            The question arises whether such differences
also occur between the various cultures of Nigeria. Are some Southern cultures
in Nigeria more calculusfriendly than some Northern cultures? Will this
difference affect their comparative performance in the computer revolution? Is
a digital divide in Nigeria likely to aggravate the local North-South divide?
Have those regional differences slowed down the process of democratization? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Mathematical prowess differs by individuals as
well as by cultures. Calculus-friendly cultures produce a larger proportion of
people who are comfortable with mathematics. This does not mean that
calculus-challenged cultures produce no brilliant mathematicians at all; it
only means that they produce far fewer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Nor should we forget economic factors,
especially in an oil-rich postcolonial society. Sometimes what may appear like
cultural reasons for the digital divide may in fact be due to economic
differences and financial access. If Southern Nigeria is economically <i>richer
per capita</i> than Northern Nigeria, then the digital divide between North and
South is likely to have economic as well as cultural reasons. Indeed, at this
stage of this kind of research, we cannot be sure which reasons are weightier
than which -economic or cultural reasons. More recently Nigeria’s revenue has
included income from natural gas, as well as from petroleum. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Nor should these issues imply that
Northerners are out-skilled by Southerners on all fronts. While there is indeed
evidence that Southerners are more economically skilled than Northerners, most
of the post-colonial period reveals that Northerners are better at the
political game. Even the electoral successes of Moshood Abiola in 1993 and
Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999 were due largely to the Northern support they
received. Indeed, Obasanjo was initially rejected electorally by his fellow
Yoruba in 1999, and supported substantially by Northerners. The only question
which arises is whether Northerners were “too clever by half” when they
supported Obasanjo. Was Obasanjo a good political investment for the North? Or
was he a miscalculation? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The secret of ultimate stability in
Nigeria does not simply lie in increasing the political power of the South — as
the Obasanjo election might have done. It also lies in increasing the economic
leverage and benefits of the North. There are wide-ranging proposals about how
to increase the political power of the South — from rotation of the presidency
to a confederal constitution. But few minds have addressed the problem of how
to increase the economic wealth per capita of the North and enhance the North’s
economic leverage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>When privatization is more widely
implemented, Northerners would have to be protected with a quota system and
other safeguards. Methods of training young Northerners to become better
entrepreneurs may have to be explored — ranging from special training to
special loans to make their business more competitive. It is important to make
Northerners more than merely inactive shareholders in the economy. Northerners
should be energetic participants in wealth-creation. A similar challenge also
faces South Africa. However in that southern Republic the divide in skills is
between races (white <i>vs</i>. black) rather than between geographical
regions. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Closing the digital divide between North
and South in Nigeria may be part of closing the more general skill divide in
the economy between the two regions. And closing the skill divide may be a
precondition for closing the gap in <i>wealth per capita</i> between North and
South. It is not enough to have a few highly visible Northern billionaires (the
so-called “Kaduna Al-Hajis,” as their critics call them). </p>

militocracy, but the future of Nigeria required greater Northern involvement in

are a new policy on language favourable to indigenous languages and a new

resource-richness before democratization reduces the motivation for democratic
reforms.  Wealth which is not created but only mined produces an affluent <i>elite
of leisure</i> rather than an <i>elite of labor</i>.  The system which emerges
is closer to a <i>plutocracy</i> (rule by rich) rather than <i>democracy</i>
(rule by the people).  We have used examples from two oilproducing countries
(Nigeria and Libya) and two resource-rich but not oil-based economies (South
Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo).  Other countries were also
mentioned to sharpen points of comparison and contrast.   </p>

down democratization, it does produce opportunities for a welfare state.

welfare state to serve all Nigerians but resulted in a local oil market which
was subsidized.  Until recently Nigerians would get their petrol below
market-value.  There were also many occasions when poor Nigerians helped
themselves to oil outside the constraints of the law.          The dilemma for
an oil-rich developing country is between using the national resources to
create a welfare state or allowing its citizens to have subsidized access to
the commodity without a welfare state. </p>

still highly vulnerable to conflicts.        The struggle for democracy and the
struggle for peace have become conjoined.  It is still an open question when
the abundant resources of each country would become a force for stability
