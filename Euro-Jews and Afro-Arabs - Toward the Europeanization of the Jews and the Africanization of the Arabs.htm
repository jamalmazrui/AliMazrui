THE SEMITIC DIVERGENCE IN WORLD HISTORY</u>, edited by Seifudein Adem.  The
oral version of this lecture will be shortened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The Semitic peoples are defined in three ways – by
language, by genealogy and by religion.  Linguistically, the Semites are those
whose mother tongues are the Semitic languages.  These languages are divided
primarily into three categories.  The Northwestern (or Northern Central) category
includes ancient and modern Hebrew and the ancient languages of Aramaic and
Phoenician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05pt;
margin-bottom:12.6pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;text-indent:-.5pt;
line-height:107%'>Southern Central Semitic languages include Arabic and
Maltese, while the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Southern Peripheral include South Arabic,
Amharic and one or two other languages of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.1pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The Semitic language of Akkadian does not fit into these
three categories.  It is often regarded as a separate category (Northern
Peripheral or Northeastern).<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
195%'>1</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>When Semitic peoples are defined genealogically, they often
respond to their lineage cultures.  In Israel, if the mother is Jewish the
child is Jewish.  In Saudi Arabia or Egypt, if the father is Arab the child is
Arab.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The third definition of a Semite is religious.  This is
easiest when defining the Jews.  Jews are people whose original language was
Hebrew or Aramaic and whose ancestral religion is Judaism.  Over the centuries,
the Jews have become less and less of a linguistic group and more of a purely
religio-cultural identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>There is also a religious definition of “Semites” which
links up with at least mythological genealogy.  By their respective myths of
ancestry, Jews and Arabs are descended from the patriarch Abraham.  The Jews
are descended from Isaac (Ishak) and the Arabs from Ishmael (Ismail).  Jews and
Arabs might, therefore, be regarded as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Abrahamic peoples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>More recently the term “Abrahamic” has been theologized and
not merely limited to genealogy.  It is not just Arabs and Jews who are
“Abrahamic”, but also the three monotheistic religions which were first
“revealed” to them.  Thus, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have more recently
been designated as Abrahamic religions.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:195%'>2</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>When the Prophet Muhammad began to preach the message of
Islam in the year 610 of the Christian era, the number of Jews had declined
from previous highs of probably as much as four to five million to between one
to one and a half million.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>3</span></sup> 
The Arabs at that time were confined mainly to the Arabian peninsula, while the
Jews were already partly scattered in the Diaspora.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.1pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The reduction of the Jewish population was partly due to
massacres by the Roman Empire in the first and second centuries, but more Jews
were lost through conversion, mostly to Christianity.<sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>4</span></sup>  The number of Arabs,
on the other hand, has increased as a result of the spread of the Arabic
language and Islam.  As a result, today there are about seventeen Arabs for
every single Jew in the world.  There may also be close to eightyfour Muslims
for every Jew.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>5</span></sup> 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In addition to numbers, there is another crucial divergence
which occurred between Jews and Arabs.  As they dispersed across their own
Diaspora, the Jews became more and more part of European history.  A process of
Europeanization began to affect this branch of the Semitic peoples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Africans began to converge into one
people.  When Islam first arrived in Africa more than fourteen centuries ago,
there were very few Arabs even in the Hamito-Semitic areas of North Africa and
the Horn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05pt;
margin-bottom:14.55pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;text-indent:-.5pt;

in the African continent.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>6

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;

spread of Islam in Africa.  We have called this AfroArab convergence as a
transition toward <u>AFRABIA</u>.</p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>What are the different stages of this Afro-Arab
interpenetration?  And what were the different historical processes which have
resulted in the Europeanization of the Jews? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Let us begin with the
Jewish story.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Euro-Jews in the Making</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05pt;
margin-bottom:12.6pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;text-indent:-.5pt;
line-height:107%'>The initial stage towards the Europeanization of the Jews was
the first major </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Jewish experience of exile.  This was the
Jews’ first Diaspora, which occurred after the Babylonian conquest of the
Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE.  Jews were forced into exile, often deported as
slaves. Cyrus the Great of Persia subsequently conquered Babylon in turn.  In
539 BCE Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to Judah.<sup><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;line-height:195%'>7</span></sup>  However, many Jews preferred to remain
abroad.  The first Diaspora was born.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>After the Babylonian exile, the only Israelites who retained
Jewish identity were the survivors of Judah.  The ten tribes of Israel proper
had been dispersed earlier after the Assyrian conquest of 722 BCE.  These
exiles did not crystallize into a Diaspora because they were gradually
assimilated by other people and lost their Jewish identity.  It was the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Babylonian exiles who
initiated the process of Diasporization.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:107%'>8</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The second major stage in the process of the
Europeanization of the Jews began with the conquest of Palestine by Alexander
the Great in 332 BCE.  This initiated a cultural phenomenon which came to be
known as Hellenistic Judaism, which responded to the cultural stimuli of
classical Greece and which flourished from the fourth century BCE to the second
century of the Christian era.  There were major centers of Hellenistic </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Judaism in Asia Minor, Syria, Babylonia
and, most impressively, in Alexandria in Egypt.<sup><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;line-height:195%'>9</span></sup>  This port city of Egypt flourished
into the largest, most productive and culturally most creative Jewish Diaspora
in this early history of Judaism.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the
population of Alexandria in that period were Jews.<sup><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;line-height:195%'>10</span></sup>  This was the second major stage in
the story of the gradual Jewish integration into European civilization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>By the middle of this Hellenistic period, five million Jews
lived outside Palestine; four-fifths of them were in the Roman Empire.<sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>11</span></sup>  In other words,
Diaspora Jews by this Hellenistic period were already outnumbering Jews in
Palestine even before the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 of the Christian
era.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The cultural period of Hellenistic Judaism overlapped with
Roman rule over the Jews.  The Roman years of 63 BCE to 135 CE included one of
the earliest attempts to establish a Jewish state.  These proto-“Zionists” of
yesteryears included Herodians, Zealots and some quasi-mostic [<b>what is this
word—mystic/monastic?]</b> groups.  These early aspirants for a Jewish state
included an expectation of a Messiah to lead them to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:2.8pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;line-height:195%'>Then
came the era of Rabbinic Judaism (2<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:195%'>nd</span></sup> to 18<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:195%'>th</span></sup> century CE).  This changed the nature of
Diasporization, but did not reverse it.  Jews as a Mediterranean people
declined, while Jews as a European people gained new impetus during this
period.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>12</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The last Patriarch, Gamaliel IV, died in 425 CE, leading to
the political fragmentation of the Mediterranean Jewry.  But the continuing
ritual role of the Jewish calendar, and the supportive roles of the rabbi, did
indeed help to ensure the survival and expansion of European Jewry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05pt;
margin-bottom:12.6pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;text-indent:-.5pt;

major stage in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Europeanization of the Jews.  Just as the
Christian Church had split between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic, the Jews
came to be distinguished between the <i><u>Sephardi</u> </i>and <i><u>Ashkenazim</u></i>. 
The Sephardi were products of the Andalusian-Spanish community, culturally
linked to Babylonia, and conditioned to some extent by the Arabic-Muslim wider
environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;

and Rome.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'> 13</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Jewish incorporation into European society was in fits and
starts, two steps forward and one step back.  In 1306 France expelled most
Jews; in 1442 Spain did the same, along with the expulsion of the Moors
(Spanish Muslims).<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'> 14</span></sup> 
By the 18<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>th</span></sup>
century there was widespread persecution of the Jews in Europe.  Conditions
were so bad that many Jews converted to Christianity (apostasy) or pretended to
be converted to Christianity (Marranism).<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:195%'>15</span></sup>  There also arose pseudo-messianic movements
and Jewish extremism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>But the persecution of the Jews also helped to stimulate
the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskala) in Eastern and Central Europe.<sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>16</span></sup>  Messianic beliefs
declined while the quests for individual achievement and collective Jewish
fulfillment on this earth gathered momentum.  This was the period when Moses
Mendelssohn produced <i><u>Jerusalem</u></i> (1783), a work which defended
Judaism not just as the spiritual heritage of the Jews, but above all as a
universal religion of reason.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
195%'>17</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The Jewish Enlightenment led to Jewish religious reform in
Western Europe, accelerating during the Napoleonic period (1800-1815).  The
Jews who were back in France concentrated on doctrinal reform.  In Germany the
reform paid special attention to the aesthetic aspects of ritual and worship. 
German Reform Judaism crystallized into a denomination.  German reform did not
spread much in Europe beyond Germany, but it found receptive constituencies in
the New World, especially in the United States.<sup><span style='font-size:

These cumulative trends were helping Jews to accommodate themselves to Western
culture without permitting themselves to be assimilated.  Even Orthodox Jews in
Europe were culturally Europeanized while remaining adherents of Judaism in
their spiritual life.</p>

Jesus Christ.  This nineteenth century young Jew was called Karl Marx.<sup><span

ways.  Islam initially arrived in Ethiopia as a supplicant for religious and
political asylum.  In Mecca followers of the young religion of Islam were being
persecuted by fellow Arabs, who were resisting the new religion as a threat to
their polytheistic and idolatrous traditions.  Uthman bin Affan (who later
become the third Caliph of Islam after Muhammad’s death) led a group of Muslim
refugees to seek asylum in Christian Abyssinia.<sup><span style='font-size:

in much of the rest of the Arabian peninsular.  And long before the end of the
seventh century, Islam arrived in another African country, but this time Islam
came as conqueror.  The Arabs annexed Egypt and initiated two processes of
monumental historical significance.  One process was <i><u>Islamization</u></i>,
meaning the spread of the Islamic religion initially in Egypt and North
Africa.  The second process was <i><u>Arabization</u></i>, meaning the spread
of the Arabic language. </p>

Christian at the time of the Arab conquest – eventually became overwhelmingly
Muslim.  Over more centuries, Egyptians became native speakers of the Arabic
language.  In time, so did much of the rest of North Africa and the Nile
Delta.  Africa had become an Afro-Arab continent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;

the Jews and of the Arabs. When Uthman bin Affan and his band of refugees
arrived in Ethiopia, their predicament was similar to that of early Jews on the
run into exile, seeking religious asylum.  But when the Arabs arrived in Egypt
as conquerors, they started a process of assimilating their subjects into the
conquering culture, rather than being assimilated by their host countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>This constituted a major difference between the <u>expansion</u>
of the Arabs and the <u>dispersal</u> of the Jews.  It was a major reason why
the Jews are now less than oneseventeenth of the global population of the
Arabs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Why did the Jews in Europe remain limited in numbers while
the Arabs in Africa dramatically grew in population?  One primary reason was
that the Arabs in Africa were exporting their culture and spreading their
religion, whereas the Jews in Europe were engaged in the politics of cultural
and religious survival.  Far from trying to proselytize, the Jews attempted to
be religiously inconspicuous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>A second reason for the growth of the Arabs in Africa, as
contrasted with the Jews in Europe, was that Arabness was defined by language,
whereas Jewishness was defined by religion.  An Arab is he or she whose mother
tongue is Arabic and who identified himself or herself with the Arabs.  A Jew,
on the other hand, is an individual who is personally a follower of Judaism or
culturally identifies with the Jewish heritage.  Until the creation of the
state of Israel in 1948, the Jews had mostly lost their ancestral languages
(Hebrew and Aramaic), while still struggling to save their religion in Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>A third reason as to why Arabs grew dramatically in
population in Africa while the population of European Jews stagnated was that
the Arabs were exogamous, responsive to racial intermarriage, while the Jews
were endogamous, leaning towards marrying within their own community. 
Interracial marriage in Arab lands tended to produce more children than <u>intracommunal</u>
matrimony among European Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>A fourth reason for Arab expansion was that Arab men were
often polygamous in Africa, whereas Jews in Europe were almost always
monogamous.  Polygamous men produced more children than monogamous ones. 
Historically, in Palestine Jews had been polygamous, but Jews in Christian lands
had to limit number of wives. Indeed, until the establishment of Israel as a
state and consequent migration, Yemenite Jews preserved several of the ancient
marriage and divorce customs, including polygamy.<sup><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;line-height:195%'>43</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>A fifth reason for why Arabs multiplied much more greatly
in Africa than Jews did in Europe was the difference between patrilineal Arabs
and matrilineal Jews.  In Arab culture, if the <u>father</u> is Arab the child
is Arab, regardless of who the mother is.  In Jewish culture, if the <u>mother</u>
is Jewish, the child is Jewish, regardless of who the father is.  But in a
single lifetime a man can make more babies than a woman.  Arab men have been
known to be still making babies in their sixties, if not seventies.  All their
babies become fellow Arabs.  But Jewish women normally stopped bearing babies
in their forties at their oldest.  Jewish matrilinealism, therefore, produced
fewer Jews by descent in Europe than did Arab patrilinealism in Africa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>A sixth reason for Arab expansion of population is that
Arabs owned slaves for centuries and children of a slave-owning father with his
women slaves were themselves free offspring (according to Islamic law) and of
Arab identity (according to Arab culture).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Jews, on the other hand, ceased to be slave owners after
they left Palestine, although some of them did become slave traders in the
Atlantic slave traffic centuries later.  Indeed, there were some Jewish owners
of Black slaves in the Caribbean as late as the nineteenth century prior to
general emancipation.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>44</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>With regard to slave-owning Arabs in Africa, their slaves
were not always Black. The slaves could be from Asia or eastern Europe or from
Black Africa.  The Arab slave system was fundamentally multiracial.  Egypt was
ruled by former slaves for centuries (the Mamluk Dynasty), but the composition
of the Dynasty was multiracial from the start.</p>

than Jews did in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Europe was because Arabs were far less race
conscious and ethnic conscious than Jews. Black children of a white Arab father
were still fully recognized as Arabs, regardless of evidence of race mixture. 
Egypt from the 1952 revolution until the end of the twentieth century had four
Presidents – Muhammad Naguib, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat and Husni Mubarak. 
The first and third presidents had black mothers and their appearance confirmed
it.  That was not an issue in Egyptian politics.</p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>Although Judaism as a religion had deeply influenced
Christianity and Islam, Jews as a people did not elicit many cultural
imitators.  The Jewish religion was a spiritual model to millions of non-Jews,
but the Jewish people were not much of a role model to gentiles.  While
conditions in Muslim Africa were such that there were many non-Arabs who
claimed to be Arabs, conditions in Europe had the reverse effect on Jews – many
Jews pretended to be non-Jews (including Karl Marx’s father and Spinoza’s
family before they left Portugal for the Netherlands).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>However, there was one area of life where Jews excelled
from almost the earliest days of their Diaspora.  They certainly became
influential intellectuals in the Muslim world – often serving as advisers to
Sultans and Emirs, and translators of the riches of ancient Greek civilization.<sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>These were the years when Muslims believed in <u>creative
synthesis</u> and were ready to learn from other people and other cultures. 
The Muslim world was ready to be stimulated in mathematics by India, in
architecture by Persia, in philosophy by ancient Greece, in law by the Old
Testament and Roman law.  Islamic civilization as a collectivity became a role
model for the Western world.  To the present day the West calls its numerals
“Arabic numerals” – having abandoned the Roman numerals for most purposes of
life and scholarship.  Individual Jews made a contribution over the years to
both Islamic and European civilizations.</p>

Battutah – who was born in Tangier, Morocco, in 1304 and died in 1368/9 C.E.,
also in Morocco.  He was probably the greatest of medieval travelers from any
culture.  He covered some 75,000 miles, detailing his observations from society
to society with meticulous care.  He covered almost all the Muslim countries

the University in Fez, Morocco.  Each of them is over a thousand years old. 
Both institutions are steeped in ancestral learning and tradition, from across
the ages.  The most influential centers of learning in the Muslim world are not
in Mecca and Medina, where Islam was born, but on the African continent – where
Islam first arrived as a refugee and later arrived as a conqueror in the
seventh century of the Christian era.  The relentless convergence of <i><u>Afrabia</u></i>
has encompassed the norms of scholarship, as well as the principles and
traditions of culture.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Conclusion</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>We have sought to demonstrate in this chapter two processes
– how one branch of the Semitic people (the Jews) became increasingly
indistinguishable from Europeans and Westerners; and, secondly, how another
branch of the Semites (the Arabs) became intermingled with Africa and the
Africans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>When Islam first arrived in Africa in the seventh century
there were almost no Arabs in Africa apart from a few traders and settlers
scattered here and there.  Today there are many millions of Arabs on the
African continent.  There are indeed more native speakers of the Arabic
language in Africa than in the rest of the Arab world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Similarly, there is more territory under Arab control
within the African continent than outside.  The largest Arab city in population
is in Africa; Cairo also happens to be Africa’s own largest city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.35pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>When Africa’s Arab population is added to Africa’s Black
Muslim population, the total would make Africa the first continent in the world
to have an absolute Muslim majority.  Paradoxically, Nigeria alone may have
more Muslims than any Arab country, including Egypt.<sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:195%'>50</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Afrabia, as a convergence between Africa and the Arab
world, has now produced identifiable people who may be designated as <u>Afrabians</u>
(rather than just “Africans” or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>“Arabs”).  <u>Genealogical Afrabians</u>
are those who combine in their veins both African and Arab genes and blood. 
Such Afrabians would include many Northern Sudanese and at least two presidents
of Egypt since the 1952 Egyptian revolution – Muhammad Naguib and Anwar Sadat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><u>Cultural Afrabians</u> would be those Africans who have
no Arab blood in them but have been substantially assimilated into Arab or
Islamic culture.  Most sub-Saharan Muslims in Africa belong to this category.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><u>Ideological Afrabians</u> are those Africans who have
neither Arab genes nor been assimilated into Arab or Islamic culture, but are
ideologically committed to trans-Saharan Pan-Africanism.  They believe in the
solidarity between Black Africa and Arab Africa – a concept of “one Africa
indivisible”.  Such ideological Afrabians in history included Kwame Nkrumah,
the founder President of post-colonial Ghana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The fourth category is that of <u>locational Afrabians</u>. 
These would include Black Africans who do not culturally or ideologically
identify with the Arabs but are citizens of a member of the Arab League (e.g.,
Southern Sudanese).  Such locational Afrabians would also include non-Black
Arabs who are citizens of non-Muslim African countries. A Coptic Egyptian who
has become a citizen of South Africa would be an Afrabian in this locational
sense.</p>

substantially assimilated Islamic and Arab culture. The Muslim population of
Black Africa is growing, both by expanding conversion and by biological
increase within African Muslim families.  On balance, sub-Saharan Muslims have
larger families than sub-Saharan Christians and larger than Muslims north of
the Sahara.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The number of <u>genealogical Afrabians</u> may also be
expanding with the growing number of interracial marriages between Arabs and

milestones in history towards the Europeanization of the Jews.  There was the
Babylonian exile following the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by Babylonia. 
Some of the Jews remained in exile, even after Persia under Cyrus made it
possible for the Jews to go back home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The second milestone in the Euro-Diasporization of the Jews
began after Alexander the Great conquered Palestine in 332 C.E.  This conquest
triggered the flowering of Hellenistic Judaism, inspired by ancient Greece.</p>

nostalgic Jewish dreams for establishing a Jewish state.  These dreams failed. 
There followed Rabbinic Judaism from the second century of the Christian era to

Diaspora expanded.</p>

was in fits and starts – with a number of anti-Semitic pogroms and periodic

and Central Europe.</p>

– a new campaign for the establishment of a Jewish homeland.  The movement was
led by Theodor Herzl.  Its initial headquarters were in Switzerland and then
moved to Cologne and Berlin.  It was ironic that a movement which dreamt about
guiding Jews <u>out</u> of Europe to a distant homeland had its headquarters in
Germany – the land which, under the Nazis, later tired to rid Europe of all its
Jewish population.</p>

historic Europeanization of the Jews.  Instead of Jews and Europeans converging
to create one people, Zionism originally aspired to divorce Jews from Europeans

profoundly worried about Jews disengaging themselves from Europe and the West.

dangerously close to disloyalty to the United States and to the European
countries of which Jews were citizens or residents.</p>

the Zionists were struggling hard to facilitate a Jewish exodus from Europe by

American Council for Judaism went moribund.</p>

movement in the 1930s and 1940s in the hope of getting rid of their own Jews
from Western countries. But the creation of the State of Israel did not result
in a wholesale exodus of Jews from the Western world to Palestine.  On the
contrary, it resulted in giving to European Jews a chunk of Arab land.  Zionism
did not result in the de-Semiticization of Europe.  It initiated instead the
Europeanization of Palestine – for better or for worse.</p>

movement towards those two destinies is surely irreversible.  The struggle
