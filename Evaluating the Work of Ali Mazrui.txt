S;/AlisPersonal/ Evaluating the Work of Ali A. Mazrui: (2nd DRAFT)Select International Responses & Commentaries/2010 
1.                  Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology Chancellor, Professor Ali Mazrui, has been nominated among top 100 public intellectuals in the world. An American journal, Foreign Policy published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in New York in September 2005, nominated the scholars . .. The London-based magazine, The Prospect backed the nomination.... A public intellectual is a person who has shown distinction in their own field and the ability to communicate ideas and influence debate outside it. . . . Last year Mazrui was voted by another London-based magazine among the ten greatest Africans. 
[Foreign Policy (USA) September 2005 and The Standard (Nairobi, Kenya) October 5, 2005.] 
 
2.                  Mazrui is Africa's leading and most independent political thinker. CHOICE, [Chicago, Illinois, USA], 1967. 
 
3.                  Mazrui proves himself learned, sophisticated and concerned. On ideology taken on its own he is excellent. NEW SOCIETY, [London, U.K.], 1967. 
 
4.                  The Trial of Christopher Okigbo is the story of . . . a world beyond the grave which combines the best of Christian, Muslim and traditional versions of heaven... . The story never gets bogged down in its arguments. It becomes its own best proof that important political questioning and art are not mutually exclusive. The Trial of Christopher Okibgo is a fine and unusual piece of fiction.  
The New York Times Book Review, (USA), 1972. 
 
5.                  Mazrui shakes up our thinking and forces us to consider a world in which existing political, economic, and cultural forces have advanced to new stages of development and importance. He anticipates, for example, a growing influence of Islam, noting that "the prestige of a religion is often positively co-related with the political and economic power of those who profess it." FSJ Bookshelf, (USA), 1978.  
 
6.                  Ali Mazrui is not only the most distinguished writer to have emerged from independent 
Black Africa, and the most penetrating and discriminating expositor of the ideology of the Third World, he is also a most illuminating interpreter of world politics. The Times Literary Supplement, [London, UK], 1978. 
 
7.                  From a methodological point of view, Mazrui demonstrates a rare intellectual brilliance. He frequently uses dichotomous schemes of classification which are genuinely original and sometimes surprisingly witty. . . . He often uses dichotomy for dialectical reasoning. The American Political Science Review, [USA], 1979. 
 
8.                  Ali Mazrui has emerged as Africa's leading political scientist over the last decade because of his insightful, elegant and voluminous output.. .. He adopts approaches and notions from several disciplines, psychology and sociology as well as theology and technology. But this eclecticism produces neither fragmentation nor disjointedness but rather a great work of synthesis and scholarship, in which diverse ideas and theories are juxtaposed and interpreted. 
Canadian Journal of Political Science, [Toronto, Canada], 1979. 
9.                  The greatest talent of Professor Mazrui is saying unexpected things. Durrants, [London, UK], 1978. 
 
10.              Reviewers of Mazrui's books almost invariably remark upon the originality of his ideas, his ability to make surprising connections and sweeping syntheses, his grasp of detail, his wit, and his ability to stimulate, enlighten and entertain. . . . Mazrui is by many accounts Africa's leading political philosopher and commentator. Research News, [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA], 1982. 
 
11.              Mr. Mazrui commands one of the most powerful intellects in Africa, and his writings have long caused resonance among the African elite. International Herald Tribune, [Paris and London], 1983. 
 
12.              Mazrui is BU's (Binghamton University's) most prestigious faculty member-he has 
taught on five different continents, written more than 30 books and published a video series on African history that aired on both the BBC and PBS . . . The American magazine Foreign Policy and the British magazine, Prospect, in 2005, nominated Mazrui as one of the top 100 public intellectuals alive in the world.

13.              The Library of Congress [USA] in partnership with the Africa Society of the National 
Summit on Africa, is launching a new literary series, "Conversations with African Poets and 
Poets." The series will kick off with a discussion on contemporary African culture by Ali Mazrui . . . one of the world's most prolific writers on Africa. [Press release from Library of Congress, Washington, DC, September 26, 2011].
