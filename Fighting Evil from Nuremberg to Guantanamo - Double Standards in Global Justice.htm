<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            One question which
the Obama war on terror has posed is whether the drone has become a weapon of
ethnic-specific targeted assassinations. Barack Obama has authorized more
specific assassinations than any other Head of State since World War II — with
the possible exception of Israel’s readiness to assassinating some of the
enemies of the Jewish state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            If the alleged terrorists against the United
States had been Europeans, like Russian communists or Austrian Nazis, would any
American President have chosen targeted assassinations as an answer to the
problem? Would an American president have signed off the killing of V. I.
Lenin, and sat up all night for the phone call to confirm </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.8pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>“murderous mission accomplished?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Muslim intellectuals
are speculating whether Obama has found it easy to authorize the killing of
Pakistanis and Yemenis because these people were neither of European stock nor
of Judeo-Christian ancestry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Obama has even
authorized the killing of U.S. citizens in Yemen without the remotest pretence
at due process. Obama has been jury, judge and executioner, not only of Osama
bin Laden but of many others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Innocent Muslims
who have been killed by U.S. drones are estimated to run into hundreds, if not
thousands. The Obama presidency  has been the presidence of assassination <i>par
excellence</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>            When President
Harry Truman authorized dropping the atomic bomb on </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945 it was asked whether it was easy politically to drop such horrendous
weapons on Asiatic populations rather than on European cities. Was President
Truman trying out a new deadly weapon on the so-called “Yellow people.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Similarly, a question
is now asked whether Obama is the new President Truman trying out drone-attacks
on Muslim populations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            On the issue of who
deserves due process instead of either execution or years of imprisonment
without trial, it is worth comparing Muslim suspects with what the United
States and its allies did about European Nazis who, directly or indirectly, had
caused the death of 50 million people. The victorious allies had given the Nazi
monsters due process at Nuremberg. They were collectively charged with
accusations of crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and the
newly-identified crime of genocide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Herman Goering, whom Hitler had chosen as his
successor in the 1930s, received a very elaborate trial at Nuremberg, although
his crimes were much worse than those of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Osama bin Laden seventy years
later. Goering remained loyal to Hitler even after Hitler’s death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Goering was
found guilty of all charges and condemned to death. But on the eve of his
execution he committed suicide with a phial of cyanide, secretly imported into
his cell in October 1946. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The main issue here is whether
the Nazis were given a proper trial while Muslims suspected of terrorism are
executed without trial under the Obama presidency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            A closer approximation to Guantanamo Bay was
Spandau Prison in Berlin. Rudolph Hess was like Osama bin Laden. Rudolph Hess
had served as Hitler’s deputy and head of the party chancellery. At his trial
in Nuremberg Hess kept losing his memory or suffered what was called “periods
of self-induced hysterical amnesia.” He was eventually sentenced to life
imprisonment to be spent at Spandau Prison in Berlin. He did have due process —
which has been denied most of the Muslim prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Rudolph
Hess committed suicide in 1987 while still in prison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>             Both the United States
and Israel are suspected of killing some of Iran’s nuclear scientists. Israel
might previously have also targeted Iraqi and Syrian nuclear scientists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>This is quite apart from targeted
assassinations of radical Palestinians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Again, contrast this with how Israel has
treated European Nazis. The most spectacular was Israel’s capture and trial of
Adolf Eichmann, who had been Chief of the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.8pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Jewish office of the Gestapo, entrusted
with carrying out the genocidal “Final Solution.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Eichmann had
organized mass deportation of Jews to extermination camps in Poland and
elsewhere. By March 1944 in Budapest he had become a leading personality in the
massacre of the Hungarian Jewry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.7pt;
margin-left:36.5pt;line-height:107%'>Though arrested at the end of World War
II, Eichmann managed to escape from </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>American custody and migrated to
Argentina. He lived there under an assumed name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Israeli intelligence
finally caught up with him and captured him on May 11, 1960. The Israelis took
every precaution to ensure that Eichmann was not assassinated. His trial began
on April 11, 1961 — the charges included crimes against humanity and crimes against
the Jewish people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Although this man had supervised the killing of
more Jews than all the Palestinians had done in totality, the Israelis gave
Eichmann due process. They wanted him to die, but after a judicial procedure.
He was executed in Israel just before midnight on May 31, 1962. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Eichmann was
eventually cremated and the ashes scattered outside Israeli’s territorial
waters. For a long time afterwards Adolf Eichmann has been the only judicial
execution carried out in Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            But in this Cornell lecture, the bulk of the
argument here is that European Nazis after World War II were treated with
greater respect and accorded more formal justice than have Muslim terrorist
suspects in the eyes of the Israelis and the Obama Presidency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Albert Speer,
Hitler’s Minister of Armaments [and his favourite architect], received more
dignity and fair play after the war than have Iranian nuclear scientists in
peace time, who have been murdered at either Israeli or American instigation.
Speer was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. The Iranian scientists were just
killed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>            Can there be
any other explanation than the thesis that even under an African-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>American presidency, Middle
Eastern Muslim lives are held more cheaply than are European lives. Nazis who
had killed millions had their say in court and could offer a legal defence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            It is possible that
the recent outburst of Muslim rage in over twenty countries concerning the
defamation of the Prophet Muhammad, had more to do with a general anger against
the United States’ foreign policy, rather than just indignation against a
fifteen-minute film abusing the Prophet Muhammad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Here we must
distinguish between systemic political contagion and episodic political
contagion. The Arab spring was a case of democratic contagion in rebellion against
tyrannical systems. On the other hand, the Muslim rage against Salman Rushdie’s
novel, <i>The Satanic Verses</i>, was a case of episodic political contagion.
Also episodic is the September 2012 outrage against the film demeaning the
Prophet Muhammad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Whether we like it or
not, Muslims across the world are more outraged by attacks against <i>Islam</i>
(the religion itself) — rather than against <i>Muslims</i> [the followers of
the faith]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            When Muslims
demonstrate against Danish cartoons, or Californian comic blasphemy, the scale
of the outpouring seems disproportionate to non-Muslims. But three </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.6pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Americans wars on Muslim countries have provoked
minimum protests from the global Ummah. Drone attacks by Obama are hardly
noticed outside South Asia and Yemen.             It would make better sense if
Muslims protested in their hundreds of thousands against deadly drones killing
innocent Muslims than against cartoons titillating Islamophobes. The protesters
should be more concerned with what is done to <i>Muslims</i>, rather than what
is said about <i>Islam</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            It is one of the
ironies of history that the etymology of the English word <i>assassination</i>
can be traced back to the Arabic language. It originally referred to people who
got intoxicated by smoking <i>hashish</i> [<i>hashishin</i> or assassins] and
became murderous as a result. [<i>Hassa</i> also means in Arabic to slaughter
people. This is an alternative etymology]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            The drone has become an intoxicant to the
Central Investigation Agency — a <i>hashish</i> of modern technology. The
resulting process has been a form of assassination. Every single casualty has
been a Muslim, without exception. Many have also been speakers of the Arabic
language, which had coined the word <i>assassin</i> in the first place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            Obama’s policy
towards the Islamic Republic of Iran has been more contradictory. Obama would
like to ensure that the Islamic Republic does not develop or acquire nuclear
weapons. One of Obama’s arguments is not convincing. He argues that the
nuclearization of Iran would trigger an arms race in the Middle East, resulting
in the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, etc.
This argument is unconvincing for the simple reason that the nuclearization of
Israel in the 1960s did <i>not</i> trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle
East. Israel was more widely viewed as an adversary in the 1960s than Iran is
in this twenty-first century. Nevertheless, there was no nuclear contagion in
the 1960s following the Israeli atomic bomb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            But while Obama seems
determined to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, Obama has resisted
pressures by the Prime Minister of Israel trying to move Obama closer towards
war with Iran. Obama seems reluctant to be drawn into his fourth war against a
Muslim country (after Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya) within four years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>            After Obama’s Address
to the Muslim world in June 2009, the Muslim ummah held its breath for a new
era in relations between the United States and the Muslims of the world. Obama
also addressed the peoples of Africa from Accra, Ghana. Those were heady days
of Americo-Muslim and Americo-African solidarity. All parties have sobered up
since then. We are back to a world of tension and banality. </p>
