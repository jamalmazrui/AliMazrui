academic globalization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> This paper is about the impact of Western-style
institutions of higher learning in Africa and the Muslim world.  During the
period of colonial rule the Western-style institutions emanated from Western
Europe, and were sometimes overseas extensions of major universities in
European cities.  Thus the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, Gordon Memorial
College in Khartoum, were de facto offspring of the University of London. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> While Western institutions in such developing countries
during the colonial period were European in conception, Western institutions in
the post-colonial era have been disproportionately American. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Let us look more closely at the similarities and
differences between Euro-colonial colleges and postcolonial American overseas
branches. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Both Euro-colonial imitations and post-colonial American
extensions were based on the assumption that the Western model of higher
education was the international “gold standard of academia.”  Both the
Euro-colonial paradigm and the post-colonial American experimentation have, in
fact, been stages in the evolution of <i>“the global university.” </i> It has
therefore been widely assumed that the syllabus and content of higher education
in Africa and the Muslim world should, as closely as possible, approximate the
education values, principles and content of the parent institutions in the
Western world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:1.8pt;

example has been the Education City in Doha, Qatar, which has been in existence
for about a decade.  It has included branch campuses of Texas A and M
Engineering, Cornell Medical School, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> A post-colonial attempt in Muslim West Africa was by
Suffolk University in Senegal.  But this turned out to be less than
cost-effective.  It has since been decided that it would be cheaper just to bring
the Senegalese students to the base in Boston, rather than continue with a
branch in Dakar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But while American extensions abroad have often closed
down because of the unhappy news of inadequate enrollment, Euro-colonial
universities like Makerere in Uganda and Ibadan were transformed into expanding
national universities by the happy news of political independence of their
countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> A related issue is that Euro-colonial universities in
Africa declined in standards partly because of the massive expansion of
enrollments due to the increase of national populations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> On the other hand, Michigan State University had to close
down a Middle Eastern campus in 2010 partly due to inadequate demand.  George
Mason University had a similar problem in the Middle East in 2011.  In the
words of Philip Altbach, a leading scholar in the field of international higher
education: “Many [branch campuses] are under-enrolled, or they may be enrolled
by people who will not fit the standards of the home campus.  That happens quite
a lot.  Are you going to damage a brand name?”<sup>1</sup>  While Euro-colonial
universities have partly suffered in standards because classes have become too
large, some post-colonial American branches abroad have suffered because
classes have been too small.  While Euro-colonial universities in Africa after
independence have often found it necessary to lower standards of student
admission because of the massive demands of an expanding population, some
American branches abroad have often felt compelled to dilute their standards of
admission because of inadequate local demand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The Euro-colonial universities were
created mainly in the first half of the 20th century when much of Africa and
the Muslim world was regarded as consisting of “low income countries.”  The post-colonial
American branches abroad developed mainly in the era of petro-wealth in the
Muslim world.  Indeed, many of the metropolitan American universities decided
to build extensions abroad in the hope that academic exports would help their
budgetary problems in the United States.  Much of the Muslim world was no
longer “low income” economically. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>But what is permitted to be taught in the
Euro-colonial institutions and in the postcolonial American branches abroad? 
During the colonial period in Louvanium University in Leopoldville [now
Kinshasa] anti-Royalist and anti-colonial perspectives were discouraged in the
classroom prior to the late 1950s.  At Makerere in Uganda the teaching of
Marxism and socialist thought was discouraged until after Uganda’s independence
in 1962 — mainly because decision-makers at the University of London were
cautious about promoting Marxism in either Africa or the Muslim world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In the post-colonial American branches in
the Middle East the ordering of books for each new semester is often
complicated and delayed because of government censorship.  In classrooms in the
Gulf states there are also religious inhibitions in any discussions about
constitutionalism and gay rights.  There are also political inhibitions
concerning discussions about relations with Israel or the history of Zionism. 
Eurocolonial taboo subjects were often very different from taboo subjects of
American branches abroad.  Some sexual topics are particularly taboo to women
students. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>While Euro-colonial and post-colonial
American branches have been important stages towards the emergence of the
global university, we should bear in mind the real origins of the global
university.  Muslim Africa virtually invented the global university in its
simpler form.  The standing monuments to that Muslim African invention consist
today of Al-Azhar University in Cairo and the Qarawiyin Center of Learning in
Morocco, both of which are over a thousand years old.  These two Afro-Muslim
institutions are centuries older than Oxford and Cambridge in England, and
certainly even more ancient than Harvard, Yale and Princeton. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>But if a range of the cultural taboos in
Middle Eastern universities can be traced back to Islamic origins, so can the
very principle of a global university.  It is not often realized that Muslim
Africa invented the global university. Then there was the distinguished
Timbuktu Academy in ancient Mali, which was a flourishing intellectual beehive before
the establishment of higher education in the Americas.  Although the archives
and other assets of historical Timbuktu are currently at risk following the
2012 military coup in today’s Bamako, those archives and assets are recognized
by UNESCO as part of the cultural heritage of human kind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The Center of Learning of Qarawiyin Mosque
(founded in 859 C.E.) is part of the origins not merely of the university but
of the <i>global university</i>.  Indeed, all the three institutions of Muslim
Africa [Fez, Al-Azhar and Timbuktu] were magnets attracting students from far
and wide across generations.  It was partly this magnetic power which gave
those early Afro-Islamic institutions an influence well beyond their borders,
and constituted the beginnings of a global university. </p>

this article, we argue that Western infuence is expressed through another
postcolonial institution — the university. Our thesis in this section is that
the university is an analogue to a multinational corporation: born as an
extension of a metropolitan university whose direction and instructions come
from a European country, the postcolonial university continues to serve other
than postcolonial interests. We must also pay attention to the symbiotic
relationship between education and economic development, and identify
strategies for changing the university in Africa and the Muslim world so it
will foster cultural as well as economic independence in postcolonial nations. </i></p>

multinational corporations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia may also apply
to <i>cultural</i> multinational corporations, of which the university is a
preeminent example. Almost all postcolonial universities started as overseas
extensions of European metropolitan institutions, and decisions about
priorities for educational development followed the dictates of parent cultural
corporations in Britain, France or Belgium. The cultural goods which the
universities sold were not necessarily relevant to the needs of the new
postcolonial clientele. </p>

decolonization of the university. The more recent American universities and multinational
businesses in the Arab world also face the same fundamental problem — <i>how to
decolonize the process of modernization without ending it</i>. An examination
of American universities abroad partly on the basis of the analogy with

labor. They still rely excessively on export markets in determining what to

surprising in view of the struggles of some Muslim nations to reduce Western
cultural influences. It becomes all the more startling if we recall how the
West originally regarded its Muslim colonies from Algeria to Indonesia.
Imperial expansion was profoundly conditioned by ethnocentrism, and
ethnocentrism is, in the final analysis, a cultural phenomenon. Images of
ruling races and subordinate tribes, and theories of Social Darwinism were
powerful cultural motives underlying the rise of imperialism. Secular and
religious evangelism were also important. Secular evangelism sought to spread
Western civilization, to end ignorance and “barbarism” in underdeveloped
societies, to marginalize religions other than Christianity, and to bring the
torch of European enlightenment to “dark and backward” societies. Religious
evangelism, committed to the spread of the Gospel and the expansion of
Christendom, even in Muslim colonies, was for a time the dominant of the two
impulses. Christian missionaries were a major lobby in Europe urging continued imperialism.
There was a time in England when the government was convinced that Her Majesty
had enough black subjects, but English missionaries thought the Church did not
have enough black followers. Nigeria was annexed partly due to missionary
pressure and other parts of Africa might not have been colonized or settled as
early, but for the pressure of religious groups. </p>

imperialism found expression through institutions established in Asia and
Africa. Economic penetration manifested itself preeminently in the
multinational company, which typically engaged in petroleum, in mining, in
selling Western products, or in growing cash crops for export. The postcolonial
university became the clearest manifestation of cultural domination. By the
1950s it had replaced primary schools and churches as the prime symbol of
cultural penetration. The functions served by these two multinational
institutions have been mutually reinforcing. The university is a cultural
corporation with political and economic consequences, and the multinational
commercial company is an economic corporation with political and cultural
consequences. At risk among students are not only indigenous cultures but also
Islamic values. Westernization and secularization often erode Muslim norms. </p>

were, French African institutions were even more intimately tied to their
parent universities. For example, French students could attend the University
of Dakar in Senegal as part of their program of study and French professors
often moved back and forth between universities in Paris or Bordeaux and Dakar.
Indeed, the overwhelming number of professors in the early 1960s at Dakar were
Frenchmen. The overwhelming majority of students were Muslim.  Integration with
the metropolitan system deeply affected the priorities of African scholars. In
West Africa, Greek, Latin, and the history of Greece and Rome formed the core
of the humanities. Plato and Aristotle were better known than the North African
Ibn Khaldun. For many years no African language, not even Arabic, could be
studied at the university level. As long as the University College at Ibadan in
Nigeria maintained formal ties with the University of London, three of its
seven one-subject honors schools were in the European classics.<sup>7</sup> At
Makerere University in Uganda, even after independence, English was the only
language taught. Later the university added French and German, followed
experimentally by Russian. All this occurred before any action was taken toward
teaching an indigenous Ugandan language, or Kiswahili (which is widely
understood in Uganda and throughout much of Eastern Africa), or Arabic (the
most important language of Uganda’s neighbors in the Nile Valley). In the

incorporated courses in African languages and culture. Students at Louvanium
were at least introduced to the history, literature, philosophy and psychology
of Africa. In addition, Louvanium offered a course of study in the Faculty of
Philosophy and Letters, called “Philologies africaines,” based substantially on
the study of African languages and cultures. Belgium’s aspiration to make
colonial education practical and relevant, and its missionaries’ desire to
produce African clergy versed in African cultural ways, contributed to cultural
relevance at Louvanium. But Louvanium was by no means completely independent of
metropolitan standards. The Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, for example,
continued to require a <i>diplôme homologué d’humanités gréco-latines </i>as a
university admissions requirement<i>.</i> The study of Islam and Islamic
philosophy were alien to such an African campus. </p>

promote Arabic south of the Sahara, or to build systematically vocabularies for
certain new areas of national life such as the law courts, parliament, and
scientific research centers, and to integrate them more fully into educational
systems, have often encountered either silent skepticism or outright derision

is the study of African music. Muslim universities are profoundly distrustful
of schools of music. Because song and dance are domains of leisure in Europe,
African and Muslim educational institutions have treated song and dance as if
they were similarly divorced from work and productivity. But in fact, these
pursuits play an important social role in both Muslim and African societies.<sup>8</sup>

margin-left:-.25pt'> While industrialized countries worry about inflation and
recession, agricultural communities worry about floods or drought. In times of
famine there is always the danger of bitter jealousies and acrimony as families
compete for meager resources. Songs foster economic solidarity when the need to
share what is available is compelling. Communities need to reassert the
importance of their collective identity, and they often turn to song and dance
not merely in quest of cheerfulness or in pursuit of morale under trying
circumstances, but also to emphasize the constraints needed to remain a
community.  Although Muslim conservatives are reluctant to acknowledge, dance
and song in a highly oral society also have significant functions in the
socialization of the young. In all countries economic socialization involves
teaching children values and skills necessary for their society’s economic
survival and emphasizes the need to serve the family. In Africa, proverbs and
songs are the devices which enable the young to memorize lessons of social
commitment and service and to remember with awe the hazards of disloyalty to
kinsmen and ancestors. Poetry is much valued in Islam but seldom when it is put
to music. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Europe’s colonization of Africa resulted in the partial
demise of African dance patterns. Many schools were started by even Christian
missionaries and others who regarded African dance as primitive and sexually
suggestive, leading to sin and collective orgies. School children were thus
discouraged from experimenting with their own dance heritage. As adults,
educated Africans moved away from traditional dance in favor of imported
varieties of ballroom dancing, and, later, rock and roll. Traditional dance
lost the respect of Africans as they became Westernized. Both Christianity and
Islam were often at war against certain African dances and songs. </p>

specialists in the arts have appeared to be supremely indifferent to this
aspect of African experience. University systems in much of Africa have no
provision at all for the study of African music. Even at universities in Ghana,
Senegal, and Nigeria, where African dance has achieved new respectability, the
sociology of African music has not yet been adequately integrated into an
effective teaching program. This fundamental feature of African cultural life
is taken seriously only by departments of theater arts at such universities as
Ife in Nigeria and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Such departments are small and

(e.g., French in Mali); and thirdly, the Arabic language (which has more

begin with the decolonization of modernity. In both Africa and the Muslim world
the process of modernization has been aided by the establishment of
Western-type educational institutions, including the university. The question
arises once again whether modernization can be decolonized without being
destroyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

all about. One could indeed define development in the Third World as
modernization minus dependency. That is the challenging equation that Muslim
and African societies face. The changes which improve living standards, reduce
infant mortality, curtail ignorance and disease, and enhance knowledge of human
beings and their environments, are ones which imperialism helped to initiate.
These changes deserve to survive. But those aspects of modernization which
reduce local autonomy, erode local self-confidence, and undermine the capacity
of Africa and the Muslim world to contribute to a genuinely shared world
culture should be eliminated. In time, the concept of modernization should
become distinct from the concept of Westernization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Like commercial multinational corporations, universities
must reexamine what they import and determine the extent to which substitutions
can reduce dependency. The university, a cultural corporation dealing in skills
and values, must ask itself: which skills need to be developed locally and
which values should the educational system sustain? Two concepts of relevance
are pertinent to this reexamination: practical relevance focusing on issues of
skills, and cultural relevance relating to issues of values. While the two
dimensions are intertwined, they can be distinguished analytically. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

American colleges abroad have been concerned with whether universities are
producing appropriate personnel for the processes of economic and social
development. Is there enough emphasis on training people skilled in modern
agriculture? Are universities sensitive to the need for veterinarians in
pastoral regions? Do they emphasize Shakespeare more than rural development? In
oil-rich countries universities are already trying to cultivate petrorelevant
skills and engineering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Many Euro-colonial universities started as liberal arts
colleges, not as training centers for skilled manpower. Part of their prejudice
against technical courses was inherited from the metropolitan powers
themselves. In much of Europe, practical courses at the university level were
latecomers and to the present day have often been placed in separate
educational institutions. Universities were reserved for the study of high
culture, for the pursuit of pure scholarship. In Africa the University College
of Ibadan in Nigeria offered courses in Latin, Greek, Christian Doctrine and
Medieval European History long before it recognized the need for courses in
engineering, economics, geology, public administration, or even teacher
training. Makerere in Uganda existed for more than forty years before it

education also involves the questions of emphasis in the applied departments
and faculties which already exist. What types of personnel should a medical school
produce, for example? Graham Bull, a distinguished British professor of

the emphasis on preventive medicine remains weaker than African circumstances
dictate. </p>

medical schools should only produce doctors who are traditionally trained and
who can be employed anywhere in the world, or whether a more limited training
program should be designed to produce large numbers of paramedical
practitioners for rural clinics. Traditionally, most Eurocolonial universities
have been reluctant to “dilute” their standards. Even the idea of different
types of medical degrees meets considerable resistance from the University of
Zambia in Lusaka to the University of Khartoum in Sudan. </p>

there is still a marked lack of interest in the phenomenon of intermediate

the humanities. We have referred to the insensitivity to African languages,
music, dance, and more generally, the oral tradition. Iranians learn Arabic
more readily than Arabs learn Farsi. Changes are taking place in some areas.
Most African historians now agree that oral traditions are proper material for
historical reconstruction. Interpretations of the African past using linguistic
evidence, oral tradition, and archeological findings have introduced important
breakthroughs in African historiography. While departments of literature have
begun to follow historians in studying oral literature, their performance has
been less impressive. Some of the best oral poetry on the African continent is
reportedly Somali poetry, but there are more urgent problems in Somalia than
recording oral poetry. </p>

tradition in historiography have been introduced. Some academic reformers have
substituted Marxian approaches to political science and economics for the
standard Western analyses, yet Marxism, though radical, is also a Western
tradition and its uncritical invocation by African scholars and Muslim
intellectuals reflects a form of residual intellectual dependence. Until
African scholars and Muslim researchers change foreign methodologies to fit the

contrast, “that most of our social ills are indigenous, that the primary
sources of our problems are native. They are rooted in the social set-up, and
most effective solutions cannot be imported, but must be the result of
deliberate reorganization of the resources available for tackling specific
issues.”<sup>13</sup> </p>

dual dependency that blames all misfortunes on external forces and seeks all

indigenous, but there are others which have been created by external forces.
Some solutions to the Global South problems require external cooperation or
changes in the total world environment, but many solutions can be found within.

requires the decolonization of modernization, then three major strategies are
needed. The first strategy concerns the domestication of modernity, a bid to
relate modernization more firmly to local cultural and economic needs. The
second involves the diversification of the cultural content of modernity. Under
this approach, the foreign reference group for an African or Muslim institution
expands beyond the West. For example, interest in Chinese culture is becoming
an imperative. The third strategy is perhaps the most ambitious: it involves an
attempt by Africans and Muslims to counter-penetrate Western civilization itself.
The first two strategies can be implemented rapidly; the third requires more
sustained patient efforts. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In the very process of producing educated manpower,
creating new forms of stratification and accelerating Westernization and
modernization, Euro-colonial educational institutions have been major
instruments through which the Western world has affected and changed the
African and Asian universe. Universities have been virtually defined as
institutions for the promotion of Western civilization. In order to change this
definition, African and Muslim societies must fundamentally influence their
educational systems. It is not enough for a local university to send a
traveling theater to villages to perform a play by Shakespeare or even one by
the Nigerian playwright, Wole Soyinka. Nor is it sufficient to establish
extramural departments and extension services, however valuable these may be
for increasing skills and expanding social awareness in rural communities.
Muslim audiences are particularly responsive to didactic plays with either a
moral or religious message. Among Arabs the love between Layla and Qays is at
least as compelling as that between Romeo and Juliet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The first task toward decolonizing modernity is to enable
the local society’s influence on university policy to balance that of the West.
In concrete terms, how can this be realized? To domesticate local educational
systems, three major areas must be reexamined: university admissions
requirements and their implications for primary and secondary curricula,
criteria for faculty recruitment, and university organization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> University admissions requirements should be reformed to
give new weight to indigenous subjects and Islamic topics. Admissions should
formally require demonstrated competence in Arabic and/or an African or other
Islamic language just as some faculties used to require Latin for entry. Some
knowledge of African history, literature, and social and cultural anthropology
should also be required for university entrance, and rigorous examinations in
these subjects should promote their teaching at the primary and secondary
levels. Similarly, dance and music should be given a new legitimacy in
preuniversity education, regardless of the sensitivities of mullahs and the
missionaries in power (Muslim or Christian). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Commitment to indigenous cultures will also affect
criteria for faculty recruitment at the university. Must all teachers have
formal degrees or should there be areas of expertise where faculty could be
appointed on the basis of other criteria? For example, there are uncertified
specialists in the Arabic language or indigenous languages who not only speak
those languages but also have a command of their linguistic properties. I know
one such specialist from Kenya who for many years taught Kiswahili in an
American University with a sophistication unmatched by many who have degrees in
that subject. In the United States he could never hope to receive tenure or
even obtain a rank above instructor since he did not possess an advanced
degree. When he returned to Kenya, the university there applied similar
standards and would not consider him for appointment as a professor. Yet the
same university would appoint a British Swahilist with a formal degree but less
intimate knowledge of certain African languages than the Kenyan had already
demonstrated over several decades. There are also superb experts in the Arabic
language, or Urdu, or Bengali, or Bahasa Indonesia who have no degrees.  What
all this means is that there is a case for broadening the recruitment criteria
to include both formal degrees and, where appropriate, demonstrable indigenous
skills. Faculties of sociology could include indigenous specialists in oral
traditions; departments of medicine could have courses in the uses of natural
herbs in treating disease and, as part of the training of rural doctors, might
even examine the medical implications of the psychology of consulting saints.
Departments of history, literature, musicology, philosophy and religious
studies could consider recruiting faculty with skills other than those honored
in Western institutions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Furthermore, the structure and organization of the
university should be examined in light of local needs. In addition to the
traditional Western disciplines, there is a case for having on the one hand, a
School of Rural Studies, encompassing agriculture, anthropology and rural
preventive medicine, and on the other, a School of Urban Studies, sensitized to
the link between city and country, labor migrations, ethnic associations,
criminology and urban preventive medicine. Other possibilities include schools
of Oral Tradition and Historiography, Languages and Oral Literature, and
Religion and the supernatural. In the years which are now unfolding, <i>water</i>
may be the big cause of conflicts of the future. Middle Eastern societies are
particularly vulnerable to rivalry about water supplies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> More generally, the university’s role in society should be
examined. In Tanzania, the late Julius Nyerere recognized a link between a
country’s educational system and its people’s economic ambitions and therefore
has sought to modify drastically the Tanzanian educational system. Under
Nyerere’s watch the University of Dar es Salaam was being reorganized to change
the type of humanpower it produces and to transform the type of values it
transmits. Changes in admissions policies, such as assessing motivation as well
as intellectual competence. Class sizes were already being determined on the
basis of planned manpower projections. While it is too early to predict the
final outcome of such experiments, Tanzania has clearly recognized the need to
domesticate its cultural multinational corporation. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Another strategy for decolonizing modernity involves
diversifying the cultural content of modernity. This approach rests partly on
the assumption that just as economically it is a greater risk to be dependent
on one country than on many, so also culturally one foreign benefactor is more
constraining than many. To be owned by one person is to be enslaved outright;
to be owned by many masters, who can be played against one another, may be the
beginning of freedom. In terms of culture, reliance on one external reference
group is outright dependency; reliance on a diversity of external civilizations
may be the beginning of autonomy. That is true globalization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> It is not enough, however, for the universities to combine
African traditions with those from the West. A dual process must occur:
increased localization, as the society is permitted to reciprocate the impact
of the university; and increased internationalization, as the foreign component
in the university becomes less Eurocentric and more attentive to other aspects
of the total human heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> It is more important than ever that both Euro-colonial and
American branch campuses take seriously the cultures and experiments of other
civilizations. The educational system should focus not only on Europe and
Africa, but also on Indian, Chinese and, most important, Islamic civilizations.
Although Arabic is the most widely spoken language on the African continent, it
has received little attention in African curricula south of the Sahara, even in
those countries which border Arabic-speaking areas or have large numbers of
Muslim citizens. This insensitivity to Arabic needs to change. </p>

practical knowledge. Both India and China have much to teach about intermediate
technology, intermediate medicine and new methods of agriculture, as well as
about ideology and economic organization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In the 20th century European imperial powers experimented
with branches of their universities located in their colonies. These Euro-colonial
educational branches included Gordon Memorial College in Sudan, the University
of Hong Kong established by Lord Lugard, and the sub-Saharan academic jewels at
Ibadan, Legon in Ghana, Makerere in Uganda, and the University of Malaya in
Kuala Lumpur. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In the postcolonial era it is American universities which
have taken the lead in establishing branches in the Global South. But the
American University in Beirut, and the American universities in Cairo and
Nairobi are not branches of metropolitan institutions but have been autonomous
cultural influences. Such inferences have helped in creating an Americanized
elite in their respective countries in Africa and/or the Muslim world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>                          Somewhere between the ancient
approximations of international centers of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>learning like Timbuktu and the more recent trends towards a
global university, there lies the stage of universities as cultural
multinational corporations. We have examined the ramifications, and the effort
to decolonize modernity. Africa and the Muslim world have needed to distinguish
between Westernization and modernization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But at least as fundamental is the issue of how much
Western science owes to other civilizations. From the Indus Valley to ancient
Egypt, from imperial China to medieval Islam, the West has found intellectual
and scientific benefactors. Very little of this history is communicated to
young children in African schools. Their sense of awe about the West becomes a
foundation for subsequent intellectual dependency. African secondary school
curricula should contain a compulsory paper which places science in its proper
historical context, reveals the diversity of the human heritage and breaks the
dangerous myth of a Western scientific monopoly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:2.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Another change which should be introduced into primary and
secondary schools would require each African child to learn a minimum of three
languages — one European, one Asian, and one African. The era of learning
multiple European languages, some ancient and some modern, while other
linguistic heritages are ignored, should come rapidly to an end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> At the university level a course on “Great Systems of
Thought,” with examples drawn from the range of human cultures, should be
required of all undergraduates in the humanities and social sciences. All undergraduates,
regardless of field, should take either an African or an Asian language at an
advanced level. In addition, they should take a course on a Third World
civilization, preferably but not necessarily linked to the language of their
choice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> University reforms will require a fundamental change in
attitude for all departments of African and Muslim universities — away from
excessive Eurocentrism and toward both increased localization and increased
internationalization. This broader focus could change the African university
into a truly multicultural corporation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.55pt;margin-bottom:
14.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'><i>The Strategy of
Counter-Penetration</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Domestication of modernity and diversification of Africa’s
cultural content will not be fully achieved until Islam can once again
influence Western civilization. There are reformers in Africa and the Muslim
world who urge only localization, some of them to the extent of espousing
cultural autarky. But withdrawal from world culture would result in the
continuing marginality of Africa and the Ummah in global affairs in a world
which has shrunk to the point where many decisions can affect the entire human
race. It would be futile for Muslims to attempt a strategy of withdrawal or
total disengagement. Modernity is here to stay; the task is to decolonize it. A
world culture is evolving fast; the task is to save it from excessive
Eurocentrism.<sup>14</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Here the strategy of counter-penetration becomes vital. If
African Islamic cultures have been so permeated by Western culture, can they in
turn affect Western thought and values? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:4.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Islamic influence was once great in the West. The West has
not completely escaped Africa’s cultural influence either. It has been asserted
that the first piece of African carving to reach Europe arrived on a Portuguese
trading ship in 1504. African workmanship in leather and probably gold reached
Europe much earlier.<sup>15</sup> Africa’s impact on jazz and related forms of
music through its sons and daughters enslaved and exported to the New World has
already been documented. So has the influence of African tales on the
literature of other lands, particularly the Southern United States and the
Caribbean.<sup>16</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But when all is said and done, Africa’s recent cultural
influence on the West has been far more modest than the West’s influence on
Africa. The asymmetry will continue for at least the rest of this century, but
the balance of cultural trade can begin to be restored. Africa will need allies
in its efforts at counter-penetration. The continent’s most natural allies
consist of the Arab world and the Black Diaspora. Arabs share a continent with
black people. Indeed, the majority of Arabs and the bulk of Arab land are
within Africa. The organization of African Unity includes both black and Arab
states. It may be possible to exploit these circumstances to the advantage of
both peoples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

started economic counter-penetration of the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:12.6pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As a result, the West, while eager for petroleum dollars,
is anxious about their long-term consequences for Western economic
independence.<sup>17</sup> There is some risk that the Arab oil producers might
start playing an imperial role in Africa. They have begun to invest in
multinational corporations operating in Africa. But with the risk of a new
imperialism comes an opportunity for a Third World alliance. Once again
economic power and cultural influence might be linked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The rise of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in world affairs, however transient, may herald the political
resurrection of Islam. Presently, twothirds of the membership of OPEC — that
portion which controls more than two-thirds of OPEC’s oil reserves — is Muslim.
Before the end of this century African Muslims may outnumber Arabs and will be making
a strong bid for shared leadership of Islam. While money for Islamic
counter-penetration would probably come from Arab oil-producers, Islamic
counter-penetration in the United States could be, in part, a process of
transmitting African indigenous perspectives. It would not be surprising if,
within the next decade, black African Muslims establish schools and hospitals
in Harlem and preach Islam to African Americans. Globalization will unravel
more surprises, every new decade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> African Americans are at least as important as Arab money
for African cultural entry into the West. As citizens of the richest and
mightiest country in the twentieth century, they form, after Nigeria, the
largest black nation in the English-speaking world. As African Americans become
more affluent, as they confront fewer social and political barriers and as they
participate more vigorously in the intellectual and creative world, their
influence is bound to rise. The rise of Barack Obama to the presidency of the
United </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>States was the pinnacle of Black
empowerment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Both Euro-colonial and American universities can play a
critical role in building the alliance with African Americans. Through black
America they could reach the other Western nations. In pursuit of
globalization, African universities would do well to encourage more African
Americans to study in Africa. Here again, Arab money could be used for
scholarships. South American and Caribbean Blacks similarly could be encouraged
to attend African universities. We should remember that counter-penetration
will take longer than diversification but it is critical for globalization.
Counter-penetration would require that Africans possess the economic and
technical resources to develop innovations which the rest of the world could use.
If Africans can build a genuine partnership between indigenous cultures and
educational systems, stimulated by the input of foreign cultural, intellectual,
and technical skills, they may become leaders, not just followers, of academic
trends. In the first decade of this century half a dozen more African countries
have become oil-rich. This petro-wealth may help African empowerment, alongside
their Arab neighbors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The full maturity of global education will come only when
Africans and Muslims develop a capacity to innovate independently. That
independence will require Africans and Muslims to attempt three great tasks:
balancing the weight of Western influence with its own culture, permitting
non-Western civilizations to reveal their secrets to their neighbors, to
researchers and teachers. Africans and Muslims should aspire to transform their
own educational and intellectual world. They should aspire to make genuine
creativity possible. Only then will Africans and Muslims be on the way toward
meeting that elusive but compelling imperative — not only to decolonize
modernity, nor even merely to participate in it, but also to help define
modernity in Islamic and African terms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>A universal religion called Islam is in search of a global
university worthy of that universalism. And a continent which gave birth to the
human species has started the process of globalizing its cultural influence.
The struggle continues. <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
