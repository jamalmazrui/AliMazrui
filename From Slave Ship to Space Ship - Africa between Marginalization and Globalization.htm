<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>When we formulated the title
&quot;From Slave Ship to Space-Ship&quot;, we did not have Senator John Glenn's
1998 space odyssey in mind. By coincidence this odyssey was happening at the
same time as this panel in November 1998. We did have in mind a link between
the slave ship and the subsequent Western capacity to launch space ships or
space shuttles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Africa and the African people made
a far bigger contribution to the technological revolution of the West than the
West did to industrial change in Africa. Walter Rodney was concerned about how
Europe retarded Africa's development. But is there not another big story-the
story of how Africa accelerated Europe's development? Did not Rodney also
contribute to this second debate? Especially in Chapters III and V of his book,
<i>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</i>. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.2pt'>How Africa Developed the West<span
style='font-weight:normal'> </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Each step in Africa's contribution
to the development of the West was itself a stage in the history of
globalization. I referred to these stages in my M.K.O. Abiola Lecture for the
African Studies Association of the United States in 1994. The era of the labor
imperative was when the labor of Africa's sons and daughters was what the West
needed for its industrial take-off. The slave ship helped to export millions to
the Americas to help in the agrarian revolution in the Americas and the
industrial revolution in Europe simultaneously. The enforced dispersal of Black
people to serve Western capitalism was itself part of the emerging
globalization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>In the era of the territorial
imperative, the West docked the slave ships away forever and launched the
gunboats in their place. This was the era of imperialism and gunboat diplomacy.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Then came the era of the
extractive imperative. Africa's minerals became the next major contributor not
only to Western economies but also to Western technology. Uranium from the
Belgian Congo was part of the original Manhattan project which produced the
first atomic bombs. Other minerals, like cobalt, became indispensable for jet
engines. There were times when Africa had 90 percent of the world's known
reserves of cobalt, over 80 percent of the global reserves of chrome, and a
hefty share of platinum and industrial diamonds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Africa's impact on the West's
technological history in this phase was heavily based on Africa's industrial
minerals. The space ship was slowly in the making. As we have reminded
ourselves at this conference, Walter Rodney's most popular book looked at how
Europe underdeveloped Africa (<i>the slave ship syndrome</i>). The other side
of the story is how Africa developed Europe (<i>the space ship potential</i>). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Rodney is better known for the
negative consequences. We need also to investigate the positive consequences of
Africa's impact upon Europe from economic production to space communication and
how Walter Rodney contributed to this other debate. Also relevant was Eric
Williams's examination of the interplay between capitalism and slavery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>We now come to areas of metaphor.
Walter Rodney's stay in Tanzania coincided with the promulgation and aftermath
of the &quot;Arusha Declaration on Socialism and Self-Reliance&quot;. Arusha is
the name of the town where the Declaration occurred in 1967. But what does the
word &quot;Arusha&quot; literally mean? It means: &quot;He makes fly (into the
skies).&quot; In standard Kiswahili the word is anarusha. In other dialects it
is simply arusha: &quot;He makes fly into the skies.&quot; Who makes fly? Ancestrally
it was God. In 1967, the year of the Arusha Declaration, it was Julius K.
Nyerere. He made socialism and self-reliance (ujamaa na kujitegemea) fly. In
the space age it could be an astronaut or a cosmonaut who makes a space ship
fly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Why is Arusha town called &quot;He
makes fly into the skies&quot;? Because the town is located close to Mt.
Kilimanjaro, whose pinnacle is the highest point on the African continent.
Kilimanjaro is the roof of Africa--from whence God makes things &quot;fly into
the skies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>It has been alleged that Walter
Rodney's inadequate command of Kiswahili was no handicap for his communication
with rural Tanzanians. I beg to disagree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>We must not trivialize the
relevance of language in human communication; otherwise we might sound like the
song: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:54.2pt;margin-bottom:
9.8pt;margin-left:-.2pt;text-indent:-.5pt;line-height:100%'><i>You don't have
to know the language -- With a girl in your arms and the moon up above, you
don't have to know the language!</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Of course Walter Rodney could
relate in friendly terms with rural Tanzanians. But being friendly is different
from being Socialist, let alone being Marxist. He could not convey his
socialism linguistically to the Tanzanian peasant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>In Africa in the 1960s and the
1970s one could not be a Marxist without being substantially Westernized
through a European language. Walter Rodney could not reach rural Tanzanians as
a socialist or as a Marxist. He could only reach them as a friendly man. In
reality a friendly man could belong to any ideology. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>A dialectic faced Walter Rodney in
relation to the twin policies of Julius Nyerere's Tanzania. Under the Arusha
Declaration, Nyerere's policy of socialism brought the national ideology of
Tanzania closer to Walter Rodney's own leftist paradigm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>On the other hand, Nyerere's
simultaneous language policy of greater Swahilization made Tanzania less and
less accessible to Walter Rodney's ideo-cultural skills. Nyerere's socialist
policies were opening up ideological doors to Walter Rodney, while Nyerere's
Swahilization policies were closing down cultural doors to Walter Rodney. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Every stage of Africa's
contribution to globalization was also a stage in its own marginalization.
Rodney was all too aware that African captives who were turned into slaves
entered the emerging world of international capitalism. But those captives were
simultaneously a symbol of the marginalization of the African peoples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Imperialism and gunboat diplomacy
made colonized Africa part of world-wide empires. But colonized people are
inevitably marginalized people. The extractive imperative made African minerals
fuel the world economy. African minerals enriched other economies rather than
Africa's own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>The space ship was also born out
of the rivalries of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union
and their respective allies. Sputnik in the firmament in 1958 put the Soviet
Union first into orbit. The Soviets borrowed a lot from Western technology, but
carried it further. The process of &quot;Arusha&quot; had been sparked out.
Soviet Yuri Gagarin was also the first man in space. The West was temporarily
beaten at its own game. The &quot;Arusha&quot; space enterprise had been
accomplished. </p>

margin-left:-.2pt;text-indent:-.5pt;line-height:107%'><b>The Cold War:
Globalizing or Marginalizing?</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Africa's involvement in the Cold
War was another globalizing experience, but in this case marginalization was
temporarily suspended. The rivalries between the two super powers temporarily
increased Africa's global strategic value and enhanced Africa's influence in
the United Nations, UNESCO, the Commonwealth, and a number of other
international forums. It was the end of the Cold War which reactivated Africa's
marginalization. The end of the Cold War was a kind of
&quot;dis-globalizing&quot; experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>Part of the dis-globalization was
good news. The end of the Cold War has initiated the second phase of the French
decolonization of Africa. This is the gradual reduction of the French informal
empire in Africa. Rolling back French neo-colonialism from Africa is partly the
result of the decline of the strategic value of Africa and partly due to the
rise of French economic aspirations for the newly liberated former members of
the Warsaw Pact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.7pt'>The good news is that the end of
the Cold War has helped to initiate the second phase of decolonization in
Francophone Africa, although there is still a long way to go before real
independence for any part of Africa is achieved. The sad news is that while
Phase II of French decolonization in Africa is part of the happier story of
progress towards African independence, French decolonization is simultaneously
part of a more sorrowful story about the end of the Cold War and that is the
wider marginalization of Africa in the world. Indeed, perhaps the worst news
about the end of the Cold War for Africa is that Africa has been marginalized
even more deeply in the following ways: </p>
