<h1>THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.65pt;margin-bottom:
1.7pt;margin-left:-.25pt'> Let me begin the lecture with observations about the
initial post-Colonial African experience of the three branches of
government—the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. As the Colonial
era was coming to an end the empowerment of indigenous Africans started with
the legislative branch. The legislature on the eve of independence was often
referred to as “the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.65pt;margin-bottom:
12.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>Leg.Co,” which was an abbreviation
of “the Legislative Council” in British Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.65pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'> The political empowerment of indigenous Africans
began with the gradual Africanization of the legislature. The process was
gradual, beginning with one or two Nominated Members of Parliament. It took a
while before elections for African parliamentarians were gradually implemented.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>                        Those were the days when oratory in
the English language had high political value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.65pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Kenya’s Tom Mboya became one of the most dazzling
orators. He became an international figure. When I met Martin Luther King, Jr.
in New York in 1961, and mentioned that I was a Kenyan student, Dr. King immediately
started discussing Tom Mboya in friendly terms and with admiration. Martin
Luther King was monitored for the company he kept. The FBI was the big brother
watching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.65pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'> In both British and French colonies initial
empowerment of Africans started with creating African legislators. The most
remarkable aspect of French policy was the admission of colonial </p>

.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Africa into French metropolitan institutions in
Paris. Both Léopold Senghor of Senegal and Felix Houphouët-Boigny of the Irovy
Coast were parliamentary deputies in France for many years before the
independence of their respective countries. The judiciary was more purely
colonial. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.65pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Odinga struck a blow for democracy in the last days
of colonial rule. Odinga was invited to the Residence of the British Governor
of Kenya, Sir Patrick Renison, and offered the leadership of the first African
government in Colonial Kenya. The event occurred in Government House (now
called State House) in Nairobi in 1960. The British Governor and the Kenyan
nationalist were both standing when the offer was made. It seemed to be the
chance of a lifetime. It turned out to be Oginga Odinga’s last opportunity to
become Premier of Kenya on the eve of independence. </p>

Governor’s offer, the Jaramogi could have presided over the release of </p>

Affairs (1963–1964) and then as Vice President of Kenya and Minister without

Kenya.  The Kenya colonial judiciary had convicted Kenyatta at Kapenguria. The
colonial executive later emancipated him. </p>

change all over Africa. Kenya abolished neo-federalism (<i>majimbo</i>) and
became more of a unitary state. The office of President was created in Kenya,

became popular in one African country after another. The motives in most cases
were to consolidate the power of those who had won the first post-colonial

with the Constitution he was succeeded by his Vice-President Daniel arap Moi.
This second Kenya President kept on being reelected without opposition as long
as Kenya was a one-party state. Presidential and parliamentary elections became
more competitive when the multiparty system was restored, and term limits were
instituted. </p>

Mubarak to succeed his father as President. Libya, under Muammar Gaddafy was
preparing his son Seif el Islam to succeed. Both those Egyptian and Libyan
plans were sabotaged by the Afro-Arab Uprising of 2011–2012. Is Arab Africa in
