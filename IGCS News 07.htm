  0in;margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:103%'>Educational
  institutions in any culture are designed to transmit four legacies to
  succeeding generations. They transmit skills, values, information (data) and
  beliefs. The balance among these four legacies may vary, partly depending
  upon the wider purposes of the particular educational instructions.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
  margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:103%'>Thus faith-schools put
  a particularly high premium on values and beliefs. Technical schools seek to
  transmit skills and know-how. In both the Muslim world and the West
  faith-instructions preceded secular and technical ones. Parents were
  concerned about issues of faith and values long before they worried about the
  skills and know-how of their children. Even at the level of universities
  Oxford and Harvard were quasi-r eligious institutions before they became
  thorough-going secular ones. We shall elaborate on this later in this essay. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
  margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:103%'>On the other hand,
  Islamic universities like Al-Azhar in Cairo and Fez in Morocco were at their
  most glorious when faith and science were intertwined. Those were the
  centuries when Islamic scholars developed algebra, logarithm, astronomy, the
  nautical sciences, and the numbers which we now call “the Arabic numerals.”
  Science was not regarded as antithetical to religion. On the contrary, they
  were interpreted as mutually reinforcing.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
  margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:104%'>The skills which were
  being transmitted were partly those of <i>functional implementation</i> (as
  in the nautical sciences). But there were also such <i>cultural skills</i> as
  poetry, philosophy and theological disputations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.5pt;text-indent:0in'>Although Idi Amin
had great personal charm, he was also a brutal dictator. He ruled Uganda from
1971 to 1979. Ironically, I was for a while Idi Amin’s intellectual hero. He
even wanted to send me to apartheid South Africa in a bid to persuade the white
racists that Black people could <i>think.</i> I was to be Exhibit A.
Fortunately for me, the South African government rejected Idi Amin’s offer of
this kind of politicized intellectual exchange!</p>

was another irony in my relationship with Idi Amin. Precisely by his being a
brutal dictator, he changed my life more fundamentally than did any other
African leader. When I fell out of favor with him, my life was at risk. Idi
Amin forced me to leave Africa for the United States. This semi-exile was
virtually for the rest of my life, though there were continuing links with
different African countries. Sometimes evil has a bigger impact on its victims
than goodness has on it beneficiaries.</p>

Kwame  Nkrumah of Ghana, although I met him face-to-face only a couple of
times. I had far less personal contact with him than I have had with at least a
dozen other African leaders. So in what sense was Nkrumah such an influence on
me? The impact was intellectual and political rather than personal. My doctoral
thesis at Oxford University was partly influenced by his ideas on Pan
Africanism [See my first book ever <i>Towards a Pax Africana: A Study of Ideology
and Ambition</i> (Chicago University Press, 1967).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Kwame Nkrumah also stimulated my vision of Africa as a
convergence of three civilizations — Africanity, Islam and Western culture.
Nkrumah called that convergence “Consciencism.” I later called it “Africa’s
Triple Heritage.” I was able to elaborate on my own concept in a BBC/PBS
television series titled <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i> (1986).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

become a taxi driver. I assumed every taxi driver owned his own car, and used
it to make a living. The very few taxi drivers in colonial Mombasa were all

the social sciences in Anglophone Africa. But the prediction about Mwai Kibaki
did not come true. He left Makerere and entered Kenyan politics. He lived to
become a Minister in independent Kenya, then Vice-President, then leader of an
opposition party, and was finally elected President of Kenya by popular vote in
2002.</p>

Technology, my first major appointment at a Kenyan University. Also ironically,
the Chancellorship was a position he himself had held jointly as Head of State,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>is true that there are some particular African
countries which have intersected with my own life more than others. Kenya is
the land of my birth and my nationality; Uganda is the birthplace of my
academic career and the initial engine of my rise to professional pre-eminence;
Nigeria is the land of my African wife’s birth [Pauline Uti] and the country
which inspired the  emotions of my only novel, <i>The Trial of Christopher
Okigbo.</i> Nigeria is also the country which made it possible for me to
combine an appointment in Africa (University of Jos) with an appointment in the
Western World (University of Michigan). The Nigerian Television Authority also
joined forces with the BBC in Britain and the PBS in the U.S. to produce my
television series, <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage.</i> Ghana was the
country which had a greater impact on my Oxford doctoral dissertation, and
Tanzania is the vanguard of my own Swahili culture. Kiswahili is my mother
tongue, and Tanzania has done more to promote it than even my own country of
Kenya. Of the three founding presidents of Anglophone East Africa, I knew Julius
K. Nyerere of Tanzania and Milton Obote of Uganda far better than I knew my own
Jomo Kenyatta or Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>South Africa is autobiographically important for different
reasons. Of all the Black intellectuals outside South Africa who tested the
apartheid system at its most raw, I was probably in a class by myself. Because
my first wife was English, and I was invited by the University of Cape Town, I
deliberately challenged apartheid on the issue of racially mixed marriages. My
challenge provoked a response from the Prime Minister of South Africa himself
at the time.</p>

own to award me a national honor from the Head of State. President Thabo Mbeki
elevated me in April 2007 to the rank of Grand Companion of Oliver Tambo.
South  Africa also produced the first Annotated Bibliography of my works
(electronic and print) from 1963 to the present. The editor and compiler is
Abdul S. Bemath, a South African librarian and Bibliographer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

Colour-line To Culture line: Is Globalization Re-Defining The Dynamic Of
Political Prejudice?” at the W.E.B. DuBois Pan-African Centre, Accra, Ghana,
Professor Ali A. Mazrui had asked: “Now that we are in the twenty-first
century, the question has arisen whether the central problem of the
twenty-first century was going to be the problem of the culture line.”
Certainly for me, there is no question that the “culture line” is increasingly
going to be of vast importance for those of us interested in the politics of
the twenty-first century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>When Professor Mazrui was a candidate for the position of
Albert Schweitzer Chair in the Humanities at Binghamton University, I was
extremely enthusiastic about Binghamton recruiting such a senior scholar who
was as interested in the effects of culture on politics as I was. I did my
little bit of lobbying (with people I knew on the State University Board), and
was gratified when Professor Mazrui became part of the Binghamton faculty in
1989. Coincidentally, one of my first tasks working for Professor Mazrui was to
proofread the galleys for <i>Cultural Forces in World Politics</i> (1990), and
as I devoured the delightful and provocative writing I was even more convinced
of the rich possibilities for scholarship on the elements of culture and world
politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Certainly since 1989 — or 1991, when the Institute of Global
Cultural Studies (IGCS)was established — Professor Mazrui, faculty colleagues,
visiting scholars, and graduate students writing their dissertations have
written reams of material on different areas of culture and politics. Since my
association with Professor Mazrui from 1989 (in both formal and informal
affiliations with IGCS), I have been privileged to have exposure to much of the
scholarship at IGCS.</p>

of culture in world politics. These functions of culture were first laid out in
his <i>The African Condition: A Political Diagnosis </i>(1980) as well as in
his <i>Cultural Forces in World Politics.</i> In Professor Mazrui’s conception,
the seven functions of culture in politics are:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As layers of
stratification</p>

margin-left:24.0pt;text-indent:-12.0pt'><span style='line-height:105%'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As means of
communication</p>

margin-left:24.0pt;text-indent:-12.0pt'><span style='line-height:105%'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As standards of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:24.0pt;text-indent:-12.0pt'><span style='line-height:105%'>6.<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And as means of
production and modes of consumption</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>We can further collapse these functions in three categories.
The first three may be regarded as <b>framing</b> functions; the fourth and
fifth as <b>communicating</b> functions; and the last two as <b>actionable</b>
functions. Theoretically, we thus have a very neat way of looking at the roles
of culture in world politics. However, to reexamine culture in world politics
in the twenty-first century, it is equally important to look at those  <b>elements</b>
of culture that are most important in affecting world politics. While “culture”
as a term has been defined endlessly, both Professor Mazrui and I are more
partial to the wider  sociological sense of the term. This sense of the term
allows us to tease out those elements (or aspects) of culture that have (and
will have) continued influences, either directly or indirectly, in the realm of
world politics. It must be noted that the term “world politics” is used because
we feel the walls between domestic and  international politics are more
permeable in the era of globalization.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Elements</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Using the Mazruian functional definitions to illustrate the
impact of culture on politics is facilitated by breaking out those elements of
culture that play important roles in politics, and detailing how each of the
functions may play out in the elements of culture. In my way of thinking, these
seven elements of culture are: religion, language, age, ideology,
race/ethnicity/ caste, gender, and popular culture. In what follows, I will
elaborate briefly on each of these. Of course, I recognize that there may be
other elements (for example, sexual orientation) of culture, but they may not
have the same global role <i>in politics</i> as the seven discussed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'><b>First,</b> there is no doubt that <i>religion</i> will
continue to be a key factor in world politics in the twenty-first century.
Religion frames issues and candidates, as for example in the case of members of
religious minorities running for the U.S. Presidency. It provides rhetorical
devices and language as in the clash between radical Islam and the West. Most
recently, there have been coalitions of religious bodies promoting policy goals
such as reducing global warming and promoting peace. Interesting questions to ponder
for the 21st century will also include whether secular India will fall to
muscular fundamentalist Hinduism and what the implications of that would be for
the region and the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:9.95pt;
margin-left:0in'><b>Second,</b> <i>language</i> — which would include not just
the medium but also the content — will also continue to be an issue in
international politics. Here it is not just the question of what should be the
national language(s), but the tensions of free speech and blasphemy or offensive
speech which will cause political controversy in the increasingly multicultural
states of the twenty-first century. These are issues not only in developing
countries </p>

Flemish population and the French-speaking Walloons in Belgium, the resentment
of the spread of Spanish in the United States due to migration, and the
continuing disputes over blasphemy between Islam and the West are examples of
the continuing role of language in world politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'><i>Age</i> may be the surprising <b>third</b> element of
culture that will create political issues. We are entering an era where “We’ve
gone from Pampers to Depends,” as Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations
population division, said in a 2004 interview. As the world increasingly faces
what may be a preponderantly female, older North and a preponderantly male
younger South, political debates about the welfare state, immigration,
acceptance of risks at home, the use of military means, and health care will be
affected by the ages of policy makers as well as their intended audiences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>Some may question the inclusion of a <b>fourth</b> element
of culture that will affect politics in the twenty first century: <i>ideology.</i>
We include ideology as an element of culture because of its framing,
communicative and actionable functions. When ideology is seen as reflecting an
“ism” — whether socialism or environmentalism, Islamism or secularism — it does
provide political actors with frameworks, language, and motivation. In some
senses, the more complex the world becomes, the more human beings will need
prisms of whatever “ism” they follow. Global complexity will also mean that
ideologies will be important in retention of identity, providing criteria of
judgment, and providing springs of motivation and a larger context for actions
resulting in production and consumption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>like religion, <i>race/ethnicity/caste,</i> much to the
disappointment of modernization theorists and linear thinkers, is the <b>fifth</b>
element of culture that continues to bedevil modern politics. </p>

margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><img width=1 height=840
src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image022.gif" align=left hspace=12>This element
continues to be important politically not just in the developing worlds of Asia
and Africa but also in the ugly politics of immigration in North America and
Europe — although the overt racism of apartheid and segregation have ended.
Globalization, far from ending these divisions, may actually complicate them in
the twenty-first century through the rise of a new “global apartheid,”
uneducated racial profiling of foreigners by fearful governmental agents in the
guise of antiterrorism and border control, and the presence of individuals —
like Barack Obama in the U.S. and Rahul Gandhi in India — who come from
previously binary ethnicities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>From the rise of the first female serious contender for the
U.S. Presidency to the implications of aberrant sex ratios in China, India, and
Russia, <i>gender</i> as the <b>sixth</b> element of culture will increasingly
affect both national and international politics. How both genders view the
world and identify themselves has important implications for formulating areas
of political concern and allocating economic resources. Differences in
communication by different genders will obviously have implications
politically. As rape is increasingly becoming a weapon of war and ethnic
cleansing, gender differences may be an important element in the prosecution of
war criminals. One of the more interesting areas of discussion is the impact of
the Information Revolution and the spread of the Internet in developing areas,
opening up promises and peril for women, as Ali A. Mazrui and Alamin M. Mazrui
pointed out in a 2001 paper “The Digital Revolution And The New Reformation:
Doctrine </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:15.8pt;
margin-left:0in'>A <b>seventh</b> and final element of culture that is related
to the global impact of the Information Revolution are those parts of <i>popular
culture</i> that have proven to have political impact. Globalization of hip-hop
and rap has led to their adoption as avenues for political expression where rap
artists draw attention to the problems of the underclass and identify across
borders with other oppressed people. Films like “Hotel Rwanda” and
documentaries like “An Inconvenient Truth” have drawn attention to political issues
like genocide and global warming. As financial and technical barriers are
surmounted, more films and documentaries will contend for our busy eyeballs’
attention. Printed material (books, plays, cartoons) have long provoked
political action, but the speed of today’s political reactions to provocative
print material gives urgency to age-old debates about free speech and
state/society interests. Finally, fashion/ dress as arenas of political
contestation (as in the case of the debates about the veil in Britain and
France, or the wearing of the kaffiyeh in the United States) will also continue
to be an example of the interaction of popular culture and politics in the
twenty-first century.</p>

from the work of Professor Mazrui and his stimulating and uncommon insights
into the area of culture and politics. I am very excited to be part of the IGCS

politics into a book-length project which will enable the detailed theoretical
examination of the role of cultural forces in world politics and contribute to
Professor Mazrui’s intellectual legacy in that area.</p>

lanka, the U.S., Canada,  UK and Japan at different stages of my life. After
completing my high school education in Sri lanka and the U.S., I completed my
undergraduate work at Denison University in Ohio, where I majored in Physics
and Political Science. At the time I have decided to pursue a graduate degree
in alternative energy use in developing countries at the University of
Pennsylvania, but then for family reasons I moved to Canada, where I pursued a
Master’s degree in Political Science (specialization in Political Economy of
Development) at the University of Toronto. That in turn led me to my doctoral

major areas we already begin to accept the Western academy’s divisions of such
areas, and the problems this poses for the gathering of knowledge and for its
subsequent use. While there is no escaping the dominant academy’s organization,
and perhaps even its need, I still attempt to break free by being driven by
questions. In terms of questions, I am particularly interested in those that
concern the poorer people of the world in their relationship with rich and
industrialized nations. In terms of disciplinary areas, I tend to write about
international political economy (IPE) broadly interpreted to include
philosophy, cultural studies, history, economics, politics, sociology and
geography among others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>This journey had great deal to do with my childhood, so let’s
start there. I had blurry recollections of Sri lankan politics due to the
insurgency by the JVP, but the events in Wollo Province in Ethiopia shaped me.
I saw the first rifle shot fired in reaction to students taking over the local
high school (where my parents taught) signaling the beginning of the
student-led revolution, which the military, and then the Dergue, sadly took
over. I remember this vividly even as a very young boy, barely able to read, as
I listened to some of the student leaders talk outside our gate. Being so
young, I had no idea at the time about what it all meant, but I knew that the
students were fed up with unfairness, and that was something a even child
understands instinctively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Then in Sri lanka as a teenager I witnessed the pogrom against
Tamils in reaction to the murder of thirteen soldiers by Tamil militants. In
Colombo I witnessed a form of class warfare as it was the wealthy Tamils the
poor mobs were after as they burned house after house after first hacking the
refrigerator, the symbol of middle class wealth. At times the mobs caught
Tamils who did not have time to escape to the safety of their Sinhalese
neighbors abodes. The story not told on Sri lanka is the one of how thousands
of Sinhalese offered refuge to their Tamil neighbors.</p>

revolution, Sri lanka was a lesson in how ethnicity is manipulated by the elite

systematically. As I was writing papers that were actually mini-theses that
challenged the conventional wisdom of the West about the rest, I was challenged
by Professor James Pletcher, an Africanist to tackle Political Science as a

International Studies Association meeting a few years ago, and that was a treat
for me.</p>

also very involved with the student government and politics on campus. I was
the President of the International Students Association (DISA), which became a
powerful voice for diversity on campus. I was also one of the Head Residents of
the Global Studies Center (GSC), along with my wonderful friend and fellow
refusnik physicist Andy McQuigg. The GSC was a hive of activity — at Denison I
used the space to achieve several things, among them to bridge the cultural gap
between the Africans and the African Americans. I was aware of the sad
misconceptions and also saw that we were all working towards the same goal,
though from different starting points and experiences. The highlight of my
Denison days was to see the divestment of university assets from firms doing
business in South Africa — this was in accordance with the wishes of the

neglected, though after 9/11 there is some wooing again.) Thus, I met and spoke
to hundreds of South Africans each summer. It was a great learning experience.
Two South Africans were particularly influential in my early political
consciousness. Charles Mngomezulu was my close friend (and we were co-workers
on the graveyard shift for campus security). He taught me that those in direct
opposition to our ideas were safer to deal with than those who gave us token
support. Nazeema Mohamed, of South Asian origin, was my other early mentor: her
energy and dedication to the cause of anti-Apartheid was something I took away
to remember the importance of praxis if one is really serious about politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Good question and well timed! It was about this time that I
first began to know about Professor Marzrui’s work via my formal interest in
“Third World” politics or post-colonial states, as I refer to it now. His work
confirmed the feeling I had that we all had origins that was rooted in
different cultures. For me, his work provided legitimacy to the feeling I was
African and Asian at the same time, given my childhood experiences in Sri lanka
and Ethiopia. I think I move effortlessly between Asian and African communities
and appreciate the positive aspects of this dual heritage, particular now as a
Canadian whose friends are of various cultures of the world.</p>

margin-left:0in'><img width=1 height=840
src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image022.gif" align=left hspace=12>At a more formal
level, Professor Mazrui’s work on the triple heritage was influential without
being obvious at the time. Although I did not debate culture vs. class with my
South African peers, that line of reasoning did inform the discussion. My South
African friends’ interests in politics were mostly on the class side of the
equation. For them, cultural clashes were the end result of imperialism and the
race and class structure such a system creates. Professor Mazrui however shows
us that culture — good and bad — was there <i>before</i> imperialism and class.
His work is thus something we should all carefully consider without believing
that somehow culture is a backward notion. I only began to grasp the deeper
implications Professor Mazrui’s influence during my Master’s work in Toronto —
such is the unlearning one must do with the imperialism of thought or Western
domination, or what Gramsci speaks of in terms of hegemony in the cultural
realm. In countering imperialism it is crucial to appreciate the cultural strength
of our backgrounds, while seeking to move away from the cultural weaknesses:
that is true path to progress in a diverse world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Culture is unfortunately left as a “soft” issue to study, even
though it is crucial to the social sciences in general. The specificity of
culture must not be pushed aside in the search for “universal relationships”
between variable that seem to leap out in certain works of such theoretical
parsimony that one wonders how useful it is in the real world where there is
more complexity. To carry on with this exercise of seeking such relationships
is to continue to incorrectly construct a world of universal half truths, as
culture is not accounted for. Such social constructions are of little or no
value — they can indeed be highly dangerous as we have seen with all imperial
incursions to civilize the “other” with really appreciating the complexity of
the other’s story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.45pt;margin-bottom:
5.75pt;margin-left:0in'>The closing of the American mind to non-Western
cultures is a result of not knowing about other cultures. Fortunately, those
such as Professor  Mazrui have tried to bridge the divide and explain culture —
his three collections of essays that is coming out in 2008 is another
contribution to tell us to think about culture. No one can deny that knowledge
of culture is crucial for the future globalized community, perhaps even more
than economics, into which we invest so much more scarce research funds. Actual
cultural studies require years and years of investment in the study of
languages, customs, etc., and it is crucial this investment take place. We are
now discovering this in the aftermath of 9/11, and perhaps wise voices will
prevail so there might be better and deeper cross-cultural understanding.</p>

away lessons from its experience. I think how one gets to Japan is also
important, as I was not an accidental arrival. How I arrived in Japan had to do
with the course of my graduate studies, beginning with my Master’s at Toronto.
At Toronto I worried over development in post colonial states, and with
instructors such as G.K. Helleiner and Albert Berry, I was properly challenged.
As a result, like many concerned with such issues, I looked for South-South
cooperation as a way out of dependency on the North.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:71.75pt;margin-bottom:

direct contact with Professor Wahidul Haque, a former Bangladeshi finance
minister, who was teaching in the department of economics at the University of
Toronto. He pushed me to think of South Asian regional cooperation for my
thesis. From his discipline of economics it would have seemed clear that 1.5
billion people in South Asia would constitute a significant market for
internally driven growth — that is, growth which is a result of domestic demand,
and not so much export reliant. However, as I wrote from <i>international
political economy,</i> I discovered the regional </p>

South Asia did not work as the regional hegemony — India, of course — did not
lead well, and indeed was mired in conflict of different proportions with every
nation that it shared borders with. Despite its visionary leaders on global
issues, India’s leaders lacked a decent vision for regional issues. Not willing
to give up on South-South cooperation, I realized then that my next move would
be to study why the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (or ASEAN) was
relatively more successful in achieving cooperation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>My work on South Asia was guided by the theories leadership,
with Susan Strange’s work on leadership and world order influencing me. I began
to think systematically about how to explain the ASEAN phenomena as a
prospective doctoral dissertation at Toronto. Then, had the fortune of meeting
Susan Strange herself, after Professor louis Pauly picked me upon reading my
one page proposal on understanding the particular success of Malaysia, a key
member of ASEAN, in attracting Japanese investment. At the time I had begun to
make the counter-intuitive hypothesis that Malaysia had <i>power over</i>
Japan. Intrigued by what I explained she bluntly told me that I was in the
wrong school to study critical international political economy of the sort I
was interested in. And very bluntly she told me that I ought to be in England.
With my ideas not being heard in Toronto beyond louis Pauly, I eventually took
up Susan Strange’s challenge and I think I was her very last student in
international political economy.</p>

src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image022.gif" align=left hspace=12>Sitting among
the dusty books in the old lSE buildings affected my thinking deeply. Rebuffed
from taking on a specifically “Strangean” view of the world by Susan Strange
herself, upon her insistence I began to think on my own, and then  Antonio
Gramsci’s use of hegemony caught my attention, as he no doubt did of so many
others. My question on Malaysia however, just lay there. I was too interested
in theory to feel the need to tackle any more empirical material. Alarmed I was
also being affected by the lSE penchant for  theory, Susan Strange pushed me to
get on the field. Then, with the help of a Monbusho scholarship, I was in
Japan. She arranged for me to report to Professor Hideo Sato, at the Graduate
School of Inernational Political Economy (GSIPE), at Tsukuba University.
Tsukuba was also located in Japan’s science city, so I was surrounded by
scholars from every field I could think of. (I was told that the Soviets had a
nuclear missile targeted at the location at one time!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:0in'>Once in Japan, I had to shed my theoretical cobwebs. It became
very obvious to me that I had to spend time in Tokyo when possible and this I
did by developing my networking skills. I attended conferences and events to
meet with several Japanese civil servants from several ministries. Eventually,
I was speaking to the senior most public servants in several ministries
understanding where power in Japan really lay. While my Japanese language
skills were non-existent to poor, despite a six-month crash immersion course,
the Japanese officials were patient and used their various levels of English to
help me with answers to questions. I had my explanation for how ASEAN became
functional: the Japanese were playing the role of leader, but so very quietly
that most did not see. Still, I did not know why the Japanese led and that
became my theoretical quest in understanding the region.</p>

margin-left:0in'>Now that is big question. let me just answer the portion of
Japan in Eastern Asia. What I am saying here has profound implications for
social science of Asia, as much has been overlooked in only linking Japan to
Asia in terms of Tokyo’s interests in acquiring raw materials, cheap labour,
markets, etc., that is a purely material view that ignores among other things,
culture. While these material interests are important there is more going on
than meets the eye. The sum total impression I gathered in my talks with
Japanese officials were that they felt obligated to the Asian region: certainly
for the barbaric effects of the Imperial Japanese Army’s occupation of Korea
and parts of China and Southeast Asia in the early 20th century, even though
few want to state that publicly due to the highly politicized nature of the
debate today. lost in the heated debate is the fact that the Japanese are also
concerned with Asia and its opinions of Japan <i>as they are Asians themselves,</i>
which is a cultural category that many political scientists of course miss.
like all Africans, Asians, and latin Americans the Japanese have like felt the
slight of racism and thus identify with the victims. like many Africans Asian
and latin Americans that Japanese too have victimized others and try their best
to absolve themselves of the blame.</p>

margin-left:0in'>Now in terms of implications of understanding the Japanese
influence, say in the area of the economy, one could say that Eastern Asian
industrialization has two parents: the West <i>and</i> Japan. According to the
logic of Gautam Sen (he was my supervisor following Susan Strange’s death) in <i>Military
Origins of Industrialization</i> the West and Japan were driven in the
direction of industrialization due to security interests. In contrast, for me,
the industrialization of the rest of postcolonial spaces was a result of the
need to economically develop as an end in itself: <i>freedom was supposed to
deliver economic development.</i> The effect of Japan on post-colonial Asian
spaces in this sense of desire for economic development was immense. On one
hand many Asians felt if the Japanese could do it, “so could we,” and this is
also a cultural category that many political scientists and economists
overlook: demonstration effects are </p>

the emulator identifies with the leader in terms of capability. No where is
this more obvious than in the discourse of the Koreans, who feel rightly that
they have been overlooked due to the attention given to Japan, despite Korea
being the civilization that was older than Japan and from whence Japan borrowed
much. Ditto the Chinese. However, Japan’s effect is not just in Eastern Asia,
as in a more pure sense, Japan also inspired countries as far away as
Indonesia, India and Turkey as evidenced by the deep interest the nationalists
of these countries showed in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:0in'>While many non-Europeans were looking at Japan, on the other
hand Japan was also happy to play the role of leader in Asia. It was certainly
cynically done in the 1930s when Japan proposed the Greater Co-prosperity
sphere. However, what the Japanese did in the last three decades of the 20th
century is much closer to the true spirit of leadership. Thus, the Japanese
parent in Asian industrialization is much more different to the Western parent.
like the Western powers Japan acted in self-interest in accessing raw
materials, markets, and cheap labor. However, unlike Western parents Japan was
of the Asian region and thus it was viewed as emulable and it in turn felt the
weight of advancing the cause of Asians and did so.</p>

mentioned, I was interested in how ASEAN nations had the kind of regional
cohesion absent in South Asia. As I began to notice, the Indonesians, the
largest power in the region of Southeast Asia was not exercising its power over
the region as did India in South Asia. Was it then just enlightened cooperation
as the liberals would have? Were all the countries merely interested in
absolute gains? That too was not possible as each country was highly concerned
with what the other gained, that is, they were interested in relative gains.

this point I realized the need to understand Japan’s role in Eastern Asia. It
was the case of classic observation here, as I had more or less stumbled on
something that was not quite what I was looking for, but that nonetheless
suggested where the explanation might lie. After getting to Japan I realized
that the Western perspective of Asia was very myopic. Japan was actually rather
thick with ASEAN and so much was happening at so many levels that I found it
hard to keep up: there were cultural exchanges, but these were well organized
and they were well institutionalized. There were Overseas Development
Assistance (ODA) loans and grants, and these were long standing and also
involved more money for economic development than even the U.S. allocated.
There were technical “exchanges” in which actually Japanese experts were sent
to even help write five-year economic plans . . .  So, I had indeed stumbled
onto a research agenda that just could not be done from a Western perch from
which everything in the East was exotic or corrupt or authoritarian . . .
certainly, the idea of Japan leading Asia’s economies was not something most
wanted to contemplate in the West. Barring the Marshall Plan (for themselves, I
might add) the West has done next to nothing anywhere in the world, preferring
instead the market to do it its work. Thus for most Western academics </p>

more obediently following the free market economics and exports and had little
to do with Japan. As I realized my time in Japan was crucial even for the

Asian cooperation. Indonesia was <i>too weak</i> compared to India to really
play a hegemonic regional role in ASEAN. Theoretically, hegemonic leadership
needed a vast disparity in power, of the likes only the U.S., China, Russia,
India and Japan enjoyed. It now seemed reasonable to suggest that Japan was in
a hegemonic relationship with Eastern Asia from South Korea to Indonesia.
However, the hegemonic relationship was not in the same vein as those systems
run by the British or the U.S. hegemonies that relied on their militaries in
the 19th and 20th centuries respectively. Rather, it seemed Japan’s leadership
in Asia was done with more consensus than imagined possible by Western
international relations narrative that limited ideas of leadership to those of
the British and the U.S. period. The materialist ideas of power in these two
examples meant that Japanese leadership was not understood in the theoretical
terms available to even in political science in the U.K. and U.S. </p>

transnationalization, its firms were dominant in most sectors of industry.
Japan’s domestic market, the second largest in the world after the U.S., was
large enough to absorb regional imports but via Japanese firms, who controlled
intra-trade that was the dominant portion. The Japanese military was indeed far
behind the U.S., but still ahead of most in the world. Thus in Susan Strange’s
terms Japan’s power was structural, and Japan had the material attributes
needed for at least regional leadership. What was missing was the label of
leader and that had to do more with theoretical weaknesses of the Western

say that there are no other powers that are similar to Japanese hegemony in
Eastern Asia. In Asia the Japanese <i>focus on the moment of consent that is
implied in Gramscian hegemony.</i> The U.S. unfortunately does attempt to seek
consent from the countries and peoples it claims to lead . . . this is the
obvious difference in the two hegemonies. Also, these two examples of hegemony
are different to British hegemony that was driven by the notion of “indirect
rule,” or co-optation of local leaders to be part of the British Empire in a
formal sense. This method the English learned after not being able capture
Scotland militarily and thus resorting to buying out the Scottish leaders and
making them lords or their realms with the backing of the English. Thus the
British perfected “indirect rule” while imparting institutions to perpetuate
that power from schools to even the currency board in Singapore (used to manage
the exchange rate even today). The U.S. might look like they try to do
something like the English, but Washington tends to bed with corrupt leaders
who have little or no legitimacy in their theoretical realm: the support of
Somoza in Nicaragua is a classic U.S. error as is the current support of the
less than legitimate Somali government. Without notions of consent in the U.S.
policy making apparatus, where it is egotistical leader who are in charge, the
U.S. violently carries out policies; this to the chagrin of many old hands in
the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency, etc. So Japan is very much
alone in their consensual forms of leadership . . . culture I am afraid has
something to do with this, in as much as Japan’s strategic weakness, which is

from, on the one hand, that Japan succeeded because it was completely
westernized to, on the other hand, the nation succeeded because it clung to its
core values and traditions. Other perspectives fall somewhere in between the
two. On the whole these views may be classified into three ideal types. Most
dominant in the period prior to the Second World War was the externally
oriented school which maintained Japan succeeded because it abandoned its
culture. According to this school Japan borrowed from the West not just
scientific techniques but also the values and institutions which support them. 
Japan’s modernization was nothing less than Westernization.</p>

<img width=1 height=618 src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image027.gif" align=left
hspace=12>According to the second, internally oriented school, Japan succeeded
because it remained loyal to its culture. It was Japan’s culture that provided
the foundations for sustained economic growth and industrialization. This
perspective not only rejected the Euro-centric notion that non-Western
societies cannot modernize without substantial input from the West but argued
that it was, in fact, Japan’s pre-capitalistic, and even feudal, culture that
prepared the necessary condition for Japan’s modernization. This view was most
fashionable in the postwar period. The third hybrid theory attributed the
success of Japan to a creative synthesis of “the Japanese spirit” and “the
Western techniques.” This approach is transcendental and has held sway across
different phases of the modernization of Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Why did Africa fail to modernize? Using the same
classificatory schema used in the case of Japan, the explanations about
Africa’s failure to modernize can be categorized into externally-oriented,
internally oriented and a hybrid. Theories such as “Europe underdeveloped
Africa” or, in general, “the industrialized world underdeveloped Africa” are
externally oriented theories. World systems theorists, dependentistas and
Neo-Marxists have sometimes advanced ideas reflective of this approach. Others
linked Africa’s underdevelopment to the “laziness of the people,” to its
“low-trust” societies or the “vampire states” in the continent. And this is the
internalist school. The paradigm that is becoming increasingly popular in
recent years among many Africanists and some policy makers is that which sees
the combination of internal and external factors as the primary culprits
collectively.</p>

src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image022.gif" align=left hspace=12>Japan’s response
to the challenges of modernization was more culturally mediated than
post-colonial Africa ever aspired. In Africa, ideology seemed to have played a
greater part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>The Japanese modified imported ideas and institutions,
ranging from Confucianism to capitalism, and adapted them to local conditions
without much concern about whether the end product had or did not have close
resemblance to the original. In other words the principle of creative
imitation, itself deeply rooted in their culture, guided the Japanese endeavor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>Africans, in the first place, did not have a major say in
the process of selecting which ideas and institutions to import. Whatever new
ideas came from abroad, they were either imposed from above/outside, or the
choice was merely a result of the conspiracy of circumstances. And yet Africa’s
postcolonial modernizers tried to stick to the script of a foreign idea as much
as possible, believing vacillating between one system of ideas and another, or
blending different systems, was a sign of indetermination. The guiding force
behind Africa’s pursuit of foreign ideas thus seemed to be ideological
authenticity even as the ultimate goal was bound up with social purpose. This
was again in contrast to the Japanese approach, which favored not only the
shifting of gears from one system to another but also one which encouraged the
blending of different systems too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>We should also bear in mind, however, that the choices which
were available to Japan were not as disharmonious as the ones with which
postcolonial Africa was confronted. Japan had the luxury of choosing between
the American model and the British, or the French and the Prussian, etc., and
these models were not always mutually exclusive to the same degree for instance
as between liberal-capitalism and Marxism-leninism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'><img width=1 height=840
src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image022.gif" align=left hspace=12>A related factor
to the Japanese proclivity to modify which also contributed to their success in
economic modernization is flexibility — the versatility to change as
circumstances require. Japanese culture allows considerable degree of
flexibility. The general tendency in contemporary Africa has not been very
favorable for flexibility; but a great potential seems to exist in Africa, too,
for developing this cultural resource. So long as African cultures attach
greater significance to experience than ideology, which they do, as studies
have demon strated, it can be argued that African cultures are not incompatible
with the principle of flexible accommodation. Africa’s cultural capital hasn’t
been fully utilized doesn’t mean that the potential is not there. Empirical
studies have also strongly suggested that cultural resources could be
revitalized for utilization even centuries after they were lying dormant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.65pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in'>We should also bear in mind that Japan’s modernizers
never sought a radical transformation of their culture in order to modernize.
They saw to it that if there was a change, it was only incremental, often with
some kind of link between the old and the new. They never doubted that one
could be modern and traditional at the same time. On the other hand, Africa’s
abortive modernization efforts were based on a host of “new” foreign ideas, and
Africa’s post-independence modernizers often sought to transform traditional
culture in a fundamental way, with little or no attempt to incorporate the
modern into the traditional, or vice versa. In the end, the old was badly
dismantled, and the also new was not in place. The effort itself was never ill
intended, of course, but the outcome almost always turned out to be
disappointing. The Japanese mobilized their energy and resources to build a
new, modern society when they were engaged in the modernization effort; they
did not labor as much to abolish age-old practices, or completely cut
themselves off from the past. In short Japan’s experience in economic
modernization bears out that it is useful to be flexible, it is crucial to link
traditional values to modern ideas, and it is imperative to rely on one’s own
cultural resources. let me now turn attention to com-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>parative politics in post-colonial Africa and
post-Cold War Japan. The reason why pos-colonial Africa is chosen is obvious;
but how about post-Cold War Japan? Japanese political scientists call the 1990s
“the years of trial.” In that decade Japan changed its governments nine times.
Despite such a high frequency of change, political transitions were
nevertheless peaceful. And it was this simple observation that leads one to ask
the following questions. Why is political change in Japan peaceful while in Africa
it is less so? Does culture play a part? At least four factors can be
identified in this context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'><b>First,</b> politics are not perceived in Japan as
a-zero-sum game, certainly not to the same extent as elsewhere, including in 
Africa. In fact one Japanese political scientist has argued that effectiveness
of a politician should be judged by the extent to which he/she could
successfully make compromises between conflicting positions. One way of
arriving at this type of compromise is by ensuring a loser of today could be a
winner of tomorrow. The Japanese have succeeded in doing just that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>In Africa, more often than not, you lose a political contest,
a contest that is sometimes bloody and violent, then that marks the end of your
political career, but it could also even mean physical extermination or
long-term imprisonment. In much of Africa the unwritten rule of the game seems
to be, unfortunately, if you are in a political contest, you have two choices:
either to win and exterminate your opponents or to lose and be exterminated.
This is where contemporary Japanese political system is at variance with its
African counterpart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:1.55pt;

src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image029.gif" align=left hspace=12>had been out of
service for one reason or another.  A net effect of political recycling is the
institutionalization of a multiple-sum game of politics, or its perception as
such. The idea of political recycling fosters the desire among political
contestants not only to be good losers but also gracious winners. In this
dynamics also lies a condition of robust cooperation among political actors
because of the large shadow of the future that guarantees that another
encounter between same political actors is almost inevitable and that defection
under the circumstances becomes unprofitable strategy. In Africa the concept of
political recycling is virtually unknown. If a leader captures a political
power he realizes that that is his only chance and should cling to it by all
means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>A most enabling factor to the vibrancy and healthy functioning
of political recycling in Japan is the transient nature of hierarchy. Even
though Japanese tend to view things hierarchically, real or imagined, political
hierarchy is also seen as transient. It does not therefore bother Keiichi 
Miyazawa, the former prime minister of Japan, to work as a Finance Minister two
years after stepping down as prime minister. The same is true about former
Prime  Minister  Hashimoto and many other ex- prime-ministers and senior
politicians. In general, in Africa, with one or two exceptions, no example
springs to mind of a leader who had been on the helms of power, had lost office
and came back to re-assume a top position in the national government, let alone
serve in a position lower than one he had held previously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'><img width=1 height=842
src="IGCS%20News%2007_files/image029.gif" align=left hspace=12><b>Third,</b>
the win-win perspective such as the above also stems from and results in the
distinct nature of conflict resolution in Japan. Japan’s political culture, on
balance, favors good rather than right if, for the sake of argument, we
disregard the fact that what is good and what is right are themselves
culturally contingent. In the Japanese system of thought, morality usually
means establishing harmony, rather than justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>The nature of conflict resolution in Africa is, on the whole,
more clear-cut: loser and winner. The Japanese follow the “winner without
loser” formula. In conflict resolution mechanism of contemporary African
politics, in general, it is as if political contestants are unable to grasp
they had won unless their opponents were humiliatingly defeated, and even
crushed — both metaphorically and literally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>The <b>fourth</b> factor pertains to the social identity of
the principal political actors. Even a cursory look at the professional
background of post-War Japanese prime ministers reveals that they come from
diverse social background. What they all have in common is a non-military
background. Not only the prime ministers, but also all the key players in the
Japanese national politics are professionals from areas other than the
military. In fact, the overwhelming majority of Japanese prime ministers and
other senior politicians had acquired at one time or another professional
training or experience in an area pertaining to economics. And virtually all of
them had gone to a handful of select elite universities in the country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Comparatively, the situation in many African countries is
quite different. In many cases, those who occupy the highest office are the
powerful; and those who are powerful have for the most part a military
background, either as former leaders of liberation movements, or as defense
ministers or senior officers in the ministry. The identity as well as
background of these individuals, it seems, also conditions them to perceive
politics as a zero-sum game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.8pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in'>Japans’ political system, like its economic system, is
deeply rooted in its culture. This is good news for Africa because it suggests
that Africa too could draw upon its own culture in devising a most suitable
system of governance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>Africa and Japan are closer culturally than it is generally
recognized. And </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:71.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>yet the Japanese are perhaps the last to
admit their culture has shared elements with African cultures; some would even
regard such a notion as bordering on blasphemy. At least three possible reasons
have relevance to the explanation of the Japanese resistance to any form of
cultural affinity with Africa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in'>The first stems from the fact that such a view clashes with
the Japanese belief that they are special people. The Japanese believe — and
they want others to believe — that they are really special. Another source of
resistance is the natural tendency of humans to distance themselves from their
less successful fellow beings. Part of the explanation has also to do with
prevalence of ignorance about Africa in Japan, and the absence of incentives to
rectify it.</p>

traditions, among others, as two of the major elements in the socio-cultural
traditions of Africa. I limit my brief discussion here to the corresponding
elements in Japan, their expressions and how they are utilized for the
betterment of the society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:70.5pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in'>It is a well-known fact that the Japanese place a heavy
premium on age. There are even some observers who characterize the Japanese
political system as being closer to a gerontocracy than it is to democracy. One
important feature of this tradition is the maximum value attached to experience
rather than ideology. The principle of seniority through which party and
government leaders are elected to office is one practical manifestation. With a
handful of exceptions all of the post-War prime ministers of Japan were senior
both in age and experience in comparison to the next in line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:64.25pt;margin-bottom:

  The wise is usually one with a wealth of experience who, in most cases, would
  also be relatively advanced in age. Although age, too, factors in the sage
