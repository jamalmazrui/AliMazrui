wrong in independent Africa. Within weeks of gaining independence, the former
Belgian Congo experienced an army mutiny which escalated into a confrontation
between President Kasavubu and Prime Minister Lumumba. The mineral rich
province of Katanga proclaimed its secession from the Congo. Major Powers were
involved and finally supported peacekeeping troops to the Congo. The UN was

which killed the Secretary-General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The Congo crisis of 1960–1965 also initiated Africa‘s
involvement in the Cold War. The newly independent African countries were
courted by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (capitalist) on
one side, and on the other, members of the Warsaw Pact (communist). For the
following three decades the Soviet Union and its allies, along with the
People‘s Republic of China, had a flirtation with leftwing African governments.
These were diplomatic flirtations between states. In terms of command of roles
in the world body, the Cold War was the golden age of Third World influence and
leverage in world institutions.  But there was also Africa‘s ideological
experimentation during this period. From the 1960s to the 1980s Africa had a
love affair with different versions of <i>socialism. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> But almost none of the African countries ruled by
Great Britain went the whole hog to Marxism-Leninism. On the other hand, <i>all</i>
the countries previously ruled by Portugal started their early years of
sovereignty with Marxism-Leninism. Countries previously ruled by France had
some governments flirting with Marx and Lenin while others were either liberal
or socialist only rhetorically. For more than fifty years the UN echoed the
concerns of Marxist-Leninist countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The Communist world‘s flirtation with Africa in
foreign policy had longer term consequences than Africa‘s own flirtation
ideologically with socialism. The members of the Warsaw Pact were prepared to
arm African liberation fighters — and speeded up decolonization especially in
Southern Africa and in the Portuguese colonies. Castro‘s Cuba even sent troops
to engage with South African troops and speed up Namibia‘s liberation, as well
as defend newly independent Angola. The UN pursued the diplomatic path of the
struggle for Namibia‘s independence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> Without the military help of socialist countries
abroad the liberation of the Portuguese colonies and Southern Africa could have
been delayed by a generation. Socialist governments abroad had a greater impact
on Africa than socialist governments at home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The big exception was Julius Nyerere‘s socialist
government in Tanzania. The socialist part of Nyerere‘s efforts was heroic, but
not spectacularly successful. But history will judge Nyerere much more as a
nation-builder than as a builder of a socialist state. His language policy
(Swahilization) and his efforts to open up the rural countryside were major
contributions to the building of Tanzania‘s sense of nationhood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> Tanzania‘s independence was in 1961 rather than 1960.
The independence explosion of that year of 1960 included the largest Anglophone
country in population, Nigeria, and the largest Francophone country, what is
now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The flowering sovereignty in 1960 also included
countries which were neither Anglophone nor Francophone — such as Somalia.
There were rich countries in 1960 as well as poor ones, like Niger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

only Nyerere, but also Kwame </p>

have been: Albert Luthuli, Archbishop Tutu, Nelson Mandela, F. W. de Klerk,
Anwar Sadat, Wangari Maathai (first woman African Peace Laureate), Kofi Annan,
and Mohammed El-Baradei.   Bad news in Africa in this period included the
Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa in 1960, Nigeria‘s civil war 1967–1970,
and the multiple conflicts of the Sudan in the South and in the West. There was
also the horrendous genocidal collapse in Rwanda in 1994. The Global Mr. Hyde
had exploded into genocide in Rwanda in that year. But in the same year of 1994
the Global Dr. Jekyll ended political apartheid in South Africa. </p>

achievements of this half century included not only Kenya‘s <i>Wangari Maathai</i>,

Johnson Sirleaf</i> in Liberia as the first elected African woman head of
state.   The most spectacular African Diaspora event this decade was <i>Barack
Obama</i> — this son of a Kenyan father was successfully elected President of
the United States. Barack Obama has become the most powerful black person in
the history of civilization. More powerful than Ramses II of Egypt, Menelik II
of Ethiopia, and Shaka Zulu of South Africa. Obama is the most powerful son of
a Muslim father since the dynasty of Harun-alRashid of the Abbasid over ten
centuries ago. But is Obama afraid of his own power? Is he a Dr. Jekyll afraid
of becoming Mr. Hyde? </p>

extensive corruption.  At the time of the Lagos Plan of Action there were

coming of age of Ali Mazrui as a scholar coincided with the birth of
post-colonial Africa in the 1960s. By virtue of his field of training and his
political instincts, Mazrui displayed great readiness to rise to the
intellectual challenges of the time. Mazrui first made a name for himself by
publishing, &#8213;On the Concept of &#8215;We are all Africans‘&#8214; in the <i>American
Political Science Review</i> in 1963.  As it turned out, this was to be an
important landmark in Mazrui‘s own intellectual development. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The article was one of the first major writings in
that journal about postcolonial Africa written by a postcolonial African
scholar. American political scientist Herbert J. Spiro noted: &#8213;Mazrui‘s
article identified him as a perceptive and original student of African
political thought.&#8214;<sup>1</sup> By publishing in the journal, Mazrui
declared that he was ready to engage intellectually one of the most vibrant
communities of scholars in his field. It was also significant that the article
should be published in an influential journal of political science based in an
increasingly influential country in the world — the United States.  Another
significance of the article had to do less with where it was published than
with what it was about: identity formation in the postcolonial African context.
It may be recalled that theorizing about culture and identity was less
fashionable in mainstream American political science in those days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The mainstream discipline was then relatively more
open not only to other issues but also to different perspectives. But why was
this so? In the 1960s and 1970s the &#8213;Third World&#8214; was drawing
special attention in the West due partly to its relevance to the strategic
interests of the superpowers. This was when the two superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union, competed for friendship with the newly independent
African states, when, for instance, Kwame Nkrumah could go to Washington and
say: &#8213;… I was appealing to the democracies of Britain and the United
States for their assistance in the first place, but that if<span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:103%'> </span>this should not be
forthcoming, I would be forced to turn elsewhere.&#8214;<sup>2</sup> The Third
World also drew attention in this period, because of the relatively unified
Southern voice regarding international economic and political issues.
Mainstream International Relations (IR), too, sought to reflect the prevailing
historical trend, with prominent  scholars engaging issues of concern to the
Third World. In fact, it was in the context of debating the issue of
international justice versus international order with Mazrui that Hedley Bull
recognized Mazrui as a formidable intellectual adversary.<sup>3</sup> Just

embraces, are not simply black or African or Third World, but global.&#8214;<sup>4
</sup>Although Mazrui‘s focus was both Third World and global, his perspective
was, and has continued to be, bottom-up. It was this postcolonial
&#8213;ideology&#8214; which Bull had in mind when he described Mazrui as
&#8213;the expositor of the ideology of the Third World.&#8214;<span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:103%'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The mainstream discipline of which Hedley Bull was a
part picked up Mazrui also because scholars were then more eager to<span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> </span>better understand
international relations in all its complexities, including by explaining or
evaluating what Donald Puchala recently described as: &#8213;… the significance
of the embittered tone, the complex motivations, the mythological
underpinnings, or the historical dynamics of North-South relations.&#8214;<sup>5</sup>
The relationship between Bull and Mazrui was, however, not a one-way street. If
J. D. B. Miller‘s account is to be relied upon, and there is no reason why not,
Mazrui, too, was a positive influence on Bull.<sup>6 </sup>Miller has recorded:
&#8213;Hedley Bull‘s contact with stimulating people like Ali Mazrui, caused
him to ask questions about the direction in which the Third World might be
heading.   Ultimately, however, it was perhaps the same bottom-up perspective
about the Third World which, to adapt a phrase from Philip Darby, not only
articulates Third World dissatisfaction with its lot but also attempts to
change it, that marginalized Mazrui in the 1970s and 1980s IR.<sup>7</sup>  The
external manifestations of how Mazrui‘s relationship with Bull eventually
soured perhaps symbolized the then emerging &#8213;paradigm shift&#8214; in the
mainstream discipline and the nature of its consequences. As Mazrui reminisced
recently &#8213;Hedley Bull thought that I carried my anti-imperialism too far
at a conference in Britain, which addressed international issues in connection
with American hostages held in revolutionary Iran in the late 1970s.  In my
speech I argued that it was a change that Americans were hostages. Most of the
time the United States held much of the world hostage to what Americans
regarded as their national interest. I spoke with passion and at one stage I
stopped speaking in a struggle to hold back my tears and prevent a breakdown.
After questions and answers Hedley Bull came to the front and said to me with a
twinkle in his eye — you are quite mad!&#8214;<sup>8</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> In the late 1970s and 1980s a general consensus was
emerging among neo-realists and neo-liberals that the Third World required a
different set of theories. Mainstream IR was reasserting its identity as
&#8213;American social science,&#8214; it was focusing almost exclusively on
&#8213;the study of great power behavior.&#8214;<sup>9</sup> The discipline
effectively closed itself off to Mazrui‘s concerns. This was certainly not the
kind of IR Mazrui had in mind when he wrote: &#8213;I experienced international
relations as a person before I studied it professionally.&#8214;<sup>10</sup>
With the study of international relations thus &#8213;provincialized,&#8214; it
was less surprising that the stars of &#8213;Third World&#8214; intellectuals
like Mazrui should begin to dim in the discipline.<sup>11</sup><span

is another reason why Mazrui was dropped by or became more obscure in the
mainstream discipline. When Mazrui later critiqued or challenged some of the
core assumptions of IR theory, he rarely deployed familiar
&#8213;theoretical&#8214; concepts. The relevance of Mazrui‘s contributions in
this period to the theoretical debates are therefore invisible unless one
laboriously sifts through his sizable intellectual outputs to distil a theory
out of his historical analyses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The 1970s and 1980s also witnessed the gradual
marginalization of the &#8213;classical&#8214; method. Fact / value dichotomy
became the order of the day, placing positivism on a solid ground as the
dominant method of research in IR. As a consequence of this, Mazrui became the
methodological  &#8213;Other&#8214; in the eyes of mainstream political
scientists, who were in Mazrui‘s own words, &#8213;… the different shades of
behavioralists in the Western world who believe that political science ought
not to include normative and value preoccupations.&#8214;<sup>12</sup> But

distance from the theoretical exchanges which characterized this period. Mazrui
was conspicuously absent from the so-called &#8213;inter-paradigm&#8214;
debates of the 1980s; apparently he chose to forget the mainstream discourse,
by whom he was also seemingly forgotten. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> While the values Mazrui had embraced and the issues he
had prioritized did not endear him to mainstream political scientists in North
America, it was therefore the method he stubbornly clung to, which made him the
ultimate &#8213;Other.&#8214; Mazrui‘s &#8213;methodological
shortcomings&#8214; were indeed apparent even in the mid-seventies although the
discipline seemed more willing to tolerate it.<sup>13 </sup>In the 1980s the
level of tolerance for &#8213;methodological shortcomings&#8214; had
substantially decreased in the mainstream IR. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> Less preoccupied as he was with
&#8213;metatheoretical&#8213; issues, Mazrui has thus contributed relatively
little to <i>theory </i>of international relations directly. Maximum
preoccupation with meta-theories is likely, in Mazrui‘s view, to make the
relevance of one theory or method loom large. It was thus also a cautionary
step for an eclectic scholar such as Mazrui not to dwell on questions like what
social theories are, how they should be formulated, and how they should be
tested. Mazrui‘s &#8213;problem-driven&#8214; approach of the triple heritage
which he formulated for exploring the African condition is consistent with such
methodological commitment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The paucity of Mazrui‘s theoretical contribution had
therefore something to do with his position on &#8213;theory.&#8214; The very
notion of an all-encompassing theory is anathema to him. To the extent we can
define Mazrui in theoretical terms; it is that he is anti-behavioralist. In <i>Political
Science and Political Futurology</i>, one of a handful of his writings about
theoretical issues, his antibehavioralist stance becomes crystal clear. For
instance, he observes: &#8213;only a thin dividing line separates scientific
prediction from fortune telling&#8214;<sup>14</sup> Was Mazrui referring here
to the &#8213;metaphysical commitment&#8214; of science? We do not know the
answer to that for sure since he did not develop the notion more systematically
as he steadily drifted away from theory altogether.   In line with his approach
described above, Mazrui is generally unconcerned about the lack of consistency
among his propositions vis-à-vis major tenets of theoretical traditions in IR.
He is abhorrent, for example, to the amoral fabric of realist theory. On one occasion,
Mazrui described Machiavelli as &#8213;the first great rationalizer of
hypocrisy and false pretenses as a cornerstone of high policy in diplomacy and
politics.&#8214;<sup>15</sup> But </p>

  nuclear disarmament, but he is also against what he had called &#8213;nuclear

  the assumption that &#8213;a dose of the disease becomes part of the

examine in a forthcoming article the issues surrounding Mazrui‘s complex
intellectual relationship with postcolonial theory. Why is Mazrui (at least) as
obscure in postcolonial IR as he is in the mainstream discipline? Why did
postcolonial IR scholars not pick up Mazrui as one of their own? Why has
Mazrui‘s scholarship not struck a chord with postcolonialism? Where could we
find the answers to these questions — in postcolonial theory, in postcolonial
theorists, in Mazrui‘s scholarship, or somewhere

of African nationalists and Pan-Africanists to break the yoke and shackles of
colonialism as well as neo-colonialism on the continent, Africa was seen by
European and other Western (or nonAfrican) writers as being both mysterious and
backward. Toward that end, Joseph Conrad (1857–1924), the Polish-born English
writer, had the audacity to pen his book, <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, in which he
referred to Africa as the &#8213;dark continent.&#8214; It would take the

descriptions. Sadly, some of these writers suffered for their radical or
ideological stances and struggles in the interests of Africa as a continent
and, to them, as a motherland. For example, Nkrumah, who was himself a prolific
writer and a fierce fighter in the anti-colonial struggle in Africa, suffered
in a variety of ways. In the end, he had his elected government in Ghana
overthrown on February 24, 1966 in a military-<i>cum</i>police <i>coup d’état</i>
that was, reportedly, engineered by Western intelligence agencies (as
documented in former CIA operative John Stockwell‘s book, <i>In Search of

Panaf Great Lives </i>(1974) and in some of Professor Mazrui‘s writings,
Nkrumah eventually died in April 1972 in faraway Bucharest, Romania, from what
Amical Cabral of Guinea-Bissau termed as a &#8213;cancer of betrayal&#8214;
(1974). Several other black leaders and scholars, too, suffered in a variety of
ways. For example, <i>Finally They Killed Him </i>(1980) was a book written by
Nigerian scholars to document several aspects of the brutal assassination of
Guyana‘s History Professor Walter Rodney, who penned <i>How Europe
Underdeveloped Africa</i> (1968), a forceful indictment of European forces
that, in his opinion, kept Africa in the domain of what Conrad saw as a
&#8213;dark&#8214; continent; Dr. Mazrui has an affinity to him, including
serving as a Rodney Professor in Guyana. Another black nationalist scholar, who
died from a mysterious illness, was Franz Fanon, author of several great works,
including <i>The Wretched of the Earth </i>(1964).<span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Professorship in the Humanities in the State University of New York (SUNY),
with residence at Binghamton, New York, Dr. Mazrui has benefitted from several
prestigious invitations to college campuses. During such visits, he performs to
his best and makes the name of Africa shine, just as he did when, in 2009, his
stellar achievements prompted the Indiana University African Students
Association (IUASA) to bring him to our campus. He held his large audience spell-bound.
It was similar to how both of us had, in an earlier period, successfully
nominated and brought on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University (headed
today by a stellar philosophy scholar, Provost Karen Hanson) two Nobel

Ghana‘s late President Nkrumah (the Osagyefo) have never forgiven the famous
Kenyan scholar for writing an essay in the early years of <i>Transition
Magazine</i>, titled &#8213;Nkrumah: The Leninist Czar,&#8214; which depicted
Nkrumah as a &#8213;Czar&#8214; of sort in Africa. To such pro-Nkrumah critics
of Mazrui, it was a &#8213;how dare him&#8214; episodic issue. Yet, that did
not dent the intellectual spirit or credentials of Professor Mazrui, who had
previously been faulted because, to his ardent critics, he first rose to
intellectual prominence by being seen as a critic of some of the accepted
orthodoxies of African intellectuals between the 1960s and 1980s; he was also
seen as an ardent critic of African socialism and Marxism, brands of which
Nkrumah as well as Tanzanian ex-President Julius K. Nyerere and others
practiced. </p>

importance, hence we have not added &#8213;traditional intellectual&#8214; as
part of the accolade. For, as we understand it from Gramsci‘s perspective,
traditional intellectuals can be seen as literary as well as scientific and
religious persons, whose positions in interstices of one‘s society has a
certain inter-class aura about it. However, as Hoare and Smith have been quoted

.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Instead, for various reasons, we see
Dr. Mazrui as being both, a public intellectual and to a large extent, and an
organic intellectual, especially with his contributions to Africa and the
Developing (or Third) World. As variously amplified, the organic intellectual —
of the Mazruian variation — happens to be, again in the words of Hoare and
Smith (1978), the ever thinking and organizing elements of a particular aura
specific fundamental social class, who can be &#8213;distinguished less by
their profession, which may be any job characteristic of their class, than by
their function in directing the ideas and aspirations of the class to which
they organically belong.&#8214; Unlike Rodney, who Columbia University
Professor Manning Marable (1986; 1987) as being part of the black intellectual
tradition, Mazrui has a firebrand intellectual prowess as opposed to radical or
revolutionary one. </p>

astute and propagandist scholarship in the interests of black people, Mazrui
has purposely utilized his political science expertise to bring Africa and
other Developing (or Third) World areas into the focus of the enlightened
world. In fact, it is due to the crusading writings of Mazrui and other black
intellectuals that is why today, we do not continue to hear some of the
ridiculous questions of the past about Africa; i.e., whether Africans live in
trees, or whether Africans have tails, as depicted in some Tarzan movies. For
example, in her excellent memoirs, <i>Living History </i>(2003) — published
immediately after being America‘s First Lady — U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, pointed out the importance of Americans learning more about
Africa. She was, indeed, pointing out several objectives for her fellow Americans

illustrated when a journalist asked me before the trip, &#8215;What is the
capital of Africa?‘&#8214; While Mrs. Clinton could afford to make a trip to
learn, on the spot, about Africa, several of her compatriots would have to rely
on great scholars like the Mazruis and others to get the needed information,
distill and use it. That, in essence is why Dr. Mazrui can also be seen as an
organic intellectual. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>With multi-faceted talents and
research agenda, Professor Mazrui‘s research interests, as can be ascertained
easily by following his prolific writings, have always included African
politics, international political culture, political Islam as well as North-South
relations. Maybe, the political Islam aspect unfortunately made an otherwise
nice Indiana-based colleague describe the indomitable Dr. Mazrui as an
&#8213;Islamic fundamentalist,&#8214; among other unflattering descriptions. In
the foregoing contexts, Mazrui writes about African topics and other issues
affecting other areas of the Developing (or Third) World. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Very uniquely, Professor Mazrui has
made sure that his writings about these crucial areas of the world do not
languish only on the pages of books. Therefore, he has taken steps to provide
his admirers and the world televised documentaries, including &#8213;The
Africans,&#8214; a 1986 Washington DC-based Annenberg / CPB Project that was a
nine-part television series by PBS and narrated by Mazrui himself. The series
did provide a historical-<i>cum-</i>political and cultural overview of the
continent within the framework of the triple heritage of the traditions of
Africa and foreign influences. Interestingly, the series was derived from two
of Dr. Mazrui‘s publication: <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i> (1987); and
<i>the Africans: A Reader</i> (1986). There were some critics, who felt that
the nine-part series was influenced by Basil Davidson‘s own &#8213;Africa: A
Voyage of Discovery,&#8214; a home television series (1984).<i> </i>Even so, it
simply means that Dr. Mazrui is not an arm-chair scholar, who sits around

  example, he was asked to give a major lecture about Ghana‘s late President
  Nkrumah, who once invited him to serve on the initial editorial board of <i>Encyclopedia
  Africana</i>. One wonders if it were a mere boldness or sheer arrogance when
  Dr. Mazrui theorized, in a public lecture in Ghana, that ex-President 
  Nkrumah was a great African, but not a great Ghanaian. He reportedly based
  his thesis on the pervading Pan-Africanist stature of Nkrumah as opposed to
  Ghana‘s internal political conditions, which prompted the public uproar that
  contributed to his overthrow in the 1966 <i>coup d’etat</i>. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:15.15pt;margin-bottom:
  0in;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:107%'>The Ghanaian

  very extravagant or expensive projects and even liberation movements

  Professor Mazrui also had his share of critics, some fairly and others
  unreasonably. For example, when Heinemann Educational Books and New York‘s
  Third Press published his 1971 novel, <i>The Trial of Christopher Okigbo,</i>
  several Nigerians were divided in the opinions. Igbos from breakaway
  &#8213;Biafra&#8214; in the Nigerian civil war saw the book as a bold
  literary exercise while anti-&#8213;Biafra&#8214; elements, who supported the
  Nigerian efforts to re-unite their country, felt that Mazrui was pandering to
  the other side. Most certainly, these were fascinating contentions.
  Non-Africans also had their take on the Okigbo story, as told by Mazrui. In <i>The
  New York Times Book Review, </i>George Davis wrote, among other details about
  the publication, that in spite of the seriousness of the questions raised by
  the book, there was something detached and also playful about Dr. Mazrui‘s 
  novel, adding: &#8213;it becomes its own best proof that important political

the Biafran war, he had published only what critics saw as a slim volume of
poems, titled <i>Labyrinths</i>. Yet, he was seen in celebrated poetry sense.
It was, therefore, not surprising that one of Africa‘s best writers, Professor
Chinua Achebe of <i>Things Fall Apart </i>fame, wrote in 1978 that Okigbo was
not only the finest Nigerian poet of his generation, but that as his poems
become widely known internationally, &#8213;he will also be recognized as one
of the most remarkable anywhere in our time.&#8214; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Another African writer, Lewis Nkosi,
had the opportunity to interview Okigbo in 1962. Seeing him as a poet‘s poet,
Nkosi saw skepticism of Okigbo‘s that his true poetic audience in Africa would
be limited, adding that he believed he was &#8213;writing for other poets all
over the world to read and see whether they can share in my experience.&#8214;
It was the unique experience that prompted his older friend, Professor Mazrui,
to write the novel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

scholars and readers have offered opinions on Professor Mazrui‘s
&#8213;Leninist Czar&#8214; essay, published in <i>Transition Magazine </i>(1966).
Many of them discussed the ideological implications, as they wondered if a
socialist scholar would have written what Mazrui wrote. They, however, did not
look at how well researched and comparative, in conclusions, the piece was, as
Mazrui started his essay with a comparison of several aspects of Lenin‘s works.
For example, he wrote that Nkrumah‘s first book, <i>Toward Colonial Freedom,</i>
&#8213;was inspired by Lenin‘s theory of imperialism … Nkrumah‘s last
publication in office is <i>Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism,”</i>
was inspired by Lenin‘s theory of imperialism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>   All of the foregoing assessments
did not cause any ripples for Dr. Mazrui‘s African readers until they saw his
other polemical assertions (of which Mzee Mazrui is famous), including this
one: &#8213;There is little doubt that Nkrumah saw himself quite consciously as
an African Lenin. He wanted to go down in history as a major political
theorist, and he wanted a particular stream of thought to bear his own
name.&#8214; Hence the term &#8213;Nkrumahism&#8214; … he also sought to be
Ghana‘s Czar. Seeing Nkrumah as an authentic African leader or writer, his 
supporters or admirers did not take kindly to these assertions. Other critics,
who sided with Mazrui‘s tantalizing essay, also wondered if the award of the
Lenin Prize to Nkrumah by the then Soviet leaders did not confirm tacitly that
he either wanted to be or enjoyed to be seen in Leninist terms. All of these
discussions, no matter the motives of the writer (i.e., Mazrui) and the
discussants, did contribute immensely to African historical as well as
political studies, and the originator of the same (Mazrui) should be applauded
for the discussions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>It is a known fact that Professor
Mazrui is at his best when his writings raise or introduce controversy, as he
would handily face his critics with methodical and purposeful debate, very
often with a very civilized approach. From that, younger generations of African
writers have benefitted and, in the end, grown or influenced to become seasoned
scholars, campus professors and writers. </p>

distinguished achievements of Professor Mazrui often remind us of some of the
axiomatic anecdotes of the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr., of Rainbow Coalition
fame. Often, when speaking to black youth, the ordained Minister would urge
them to leave all distractions as well as family shortcomings behind and,
instead, to strive to become &#8213;Somebody&#8214; in life. In his preacher‘s
voice, he would draw all sorts of analogies for the benefit of the youngsters;
he would say to the youngsters; that some of them felt or thought that having
been born in a ghetto should be a barring factor toward their growth and
aspirations, and urging them further: &#8213;You might have been born in a
ghetto, but always remember that the ghetto is not in you, just as when a
pregnant dog enters an oven to deliver its babies, we do not call them
biscuits, but we still see them as puppies.&#8214; Malcolm X, too, used the
analogy of a cat giving birth in an oven: the babies produced by the cat were
still kitten but not biscuits. Drawing on the wise words of Rev. Jackson and
Malcolm X, therefore, boils down to the fact that Dr. Mazrui was, for example,
born in Mombasa, Kenya, an African country that would, in the early 1960s, be
known for its violent anti-colonial indigenous organization called the <i>Mau-Mau
</i>movement. In fact<i>, </i>in his biographical anecdotes, it is often
indicated that the young Mazrui (born on February 24, 1933) studied at schools
in Mombasa, in Kenya. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>No matter the amenities that the
Mombasa schools lacked, young Mazrui was so determined that he went on to the
United Kingdom, where he enrolled at University of Manchester to earn his
Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 1960 with distinction, his Master of Arts
(M.A.) degree in 1961 from an Ivy League institution (Columbia University) of
New York City, USA, followed by his Doctor of Philosophy (D. Phil.) degree in
1966 from Nuffield College, University of Oxford. The immediate query is
whether or not Mazrui, upon bagging his terminal Oxford D. Phil. degree (with
Molly, an English spouse in tow) made him a &#8213;Westerner&#8214;, abandoned
Mother Africa for the greener pastures of the Western World or, in essence,
failed to return to Africa to contribute his economic and intellectual quota?
No, he did not do so. If anything, he would return to Africa, via Uganda, to
begin his great teaching career and distinguished scholarship! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Therefore, we can answer the query
that he did not exactly disappoint Mother Africa! Instead, the African Patriot
in the young Dr. Mazrui (just like the patriotism of Ghana‘s Uncle Joe and
other nationalist leaders) took over for him to reurn to the Motherland via
Makerere University; indeed, he reminds us a lot of this same serious African
patriot, &#8213;Uncle&#8214; Joe Appiah of Ghana that we mentioned earlier and
above. Attorney Appiah — who can as well be described like Dr. Mazrui as a
public intellectual — wrote the great memoir, <i>African</i> Patriot; the
U.K.-trained Attorney (or Lawyer) was so transparently patriotic and African
that many of his Ghanaian compatriots very strongly harbor the feeling today
that he (Uncle Joe) was one of the best Presidents that Ghana never had the
opportunity to have in leadership! Like Dr. Mazrui, he also returned to Ghana
with British credentials and, Lady Peggy Appiah, his British spouse, to whom he
affectionately dedicated his published brilliant and very useful memoirs. </p>

professional Upon attaining academic or professional laurels, these
accomplished African students returned to the Motherland (Africa) to work,
mostly out of patriotism and nationalist pride. For example, out of patriotic
zeal and also ever ready to serve his fellow Africans in need of high quality
education, Dr. Mazrui joined the faculty of Uganda-based Makerere University
and, between 1966 and 1973, served as the head of the Department of Political
and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences. At Makerere, he teamed up with
other young scholars to &#8213;mint&#8214; new and young minds. In fact, in
Europe, we en-countered Dr. Krespo Muyonga, a former Ugandan diplomat in India,
who earned his honors political science degree as &#8213;a Mazrui
student.&#8214; At Makerere, Krespo, as a mentee of Dr. Mazrui, was elected the
President of the Student Government. He, like his mentor (Professor Mazrui) was
forced into exile by Idi Amin‘s regime. That was when, between 1974 and 1988, Mazrui
worked for University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, three years of which he
promoted Africa and African diaspora studies as Director of the Center for
Afro-American and African Studies (1978–1981). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>When Professor Mazrui left Michigan in
1989, at the direct urging of then New York Governor Mario Cuomo to accept a
New York-based endowed professorship, he followed the proverbial footsteps of
Toni Morrison as the Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities and,
subsequently, as the founding Director of the Institute of Global Cultural
Studies (IGCS), through which he brought some of Africa‘s brilliant minds and 
public figures to his campus, including Professors Soyinka, Adu-Boahen and
several others; Nigeria‘s former Head of State, Dr. Yakubu Gowon, has visited
the campus as well, which adds up to show Dr. Mazrui‘s eminent stature in
African affairs.  </p>

.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>To many Mazruian admirers, it was note
worthy that the endowed position he went to occupy at  Binghamton University of
the State University of New York (SUNY)  was named after a medical doctor, who
did a lot for Africa and Africans, particularly in the Congo sub-region. Dr.
Albert Schweitzer, who was born in Germany on January 14, 1875 and died at 90
years old on September 4, 1965, in fact received the Nobel Peace Prize for his
philosophy of reverence for life, which he expressed actively in founding and
sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambarene, the area in Central
Africa that is today called Republic of Gabon. While Mazrui today writes
prolifically to make his works available to humanity, it is also a fact that
Schweitzer had a passionate quest to introduce a universal ethical philosophy
that would subsequently be enveloped in a universal reality. </p>

concurrent faculty appointments and other positions that have PanAfrican input:
as Albert Luthuli Professor-at-Large Emeritusin Jos, Nigeria, and Senior
Scholar in Africana Studies at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York; and until

does not concentrate his intellectual and professional benevolence in Africa.
In fact, when Guyana‘s educational leaders saw fit to inaugurate Walter Rodney
Professorship on the Guyana campus of the University of Guyana, it was to Dr.
Mazrui that they turned, thereby making him the inaugural Walter Rodney
Professor. He traveled all the way to Georgetown, Guyana, for the inaugural
festivities; holding the position for several years, he retired from tit in
1999. Also, to propagate African studies and scholarship, Professor Mazrui has
traveled far and wide as well as held visiting professorships and lectureships

Bolivia in the Sociology and Political Science Department of the <i>Universidad
Mayor de San Andres</i>. During my second year at the University there was a
military coup and the university closed. Many university students were taken in
custody. Some spent some time in jail, others were deported, and others looked
for asylum at the embassies. As a result, I moved to Quito, Ecuador where I
continued my studies at the <i>Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador</i>.
There I obtained my bachelors degree in Sociology and Political Science. Later,
I completed my M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Sociology at Binghamton University. </p>

grassroots social movements, and particularly in the struggles of indigenous
people. Many social movements have developed around struggles over land and
natural resources, and I am interested in how people‘s relationships to land,
or the relationships they want to have with land, influence how they define
their political goals and strategies. My doctoral research was on how trade and
commerce in Botswana was organized along lines of race and ethnicity. This has
led me to be interested in the roles of race, ethnicity, and culture as sources
of identity as well as organizing axes of human productive activities. </p>

networks of trade and commerce in colonial Botswana developed along ethnic
lines. Africans were largely excluded from entrepreneurial roles by the
colonial authorities. However, the Europeans who were there representing
colonial authorities were only interested in those aspects of trade and
commerce that had to do with generating wealth for Great Britain and extending
British power in southern Africa. This left many spaces that were filled by
Asians, but with many restrictions. As a result, trade and commerce was
organized along ethnic lines, according to a racial hierarchy that was enforced
by the colonial government, but which functioned on a day-to-day basis based on
informal rules. When Botswana became independent, the ethnic organization of
trade and commerce, along with the informal arrangements among different ethnic
groups, continued in the new context. </p>

style='font-family:"Wingdings 3"'>p</span><b> </b> There is currently great
worldwide concern about environmental issues generally, and the specific
actions needed to address the impacts of climate change. Developing countries
are a focal point of this concern, and numerous donor organizations are providing
financial support in the name of improving their capacity to manage natural
resources. This may be seen in a variety of areas, including from policy
reforms to reduce carbon emissions and manage carbon stocks, local-level
projects to make the farming systems of poor families more resilient in the
face of climate change, and the promotion of clean energy ranging from the
promotion of more efficient cook stoves to support for alternate fuel development.
While diverse in their specific content these efforts share stated objectives
to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Because efforts to promote
environmental conservation and/or environmentally sustainable economic growth
challenge explicitly or implicitly models of economic  growth that have
dominated the thinking of donor organizations until very recently, there is a
widespread assumption that poor people will be major beneficiaries of
development efforts based on the new environmental consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> This assumption is particularly strong with respect to
indigenous peoples in Latin America. Not only are they among the poorest and
most oppressed people within many of the states in which they reside, we also
tend to regard them as part of the environment we seek to protect. This vision
contrasts with our self-image, which tends to view the growth of Western
society as a progressive distancing from the limitations imposed by the natural
environment. Thus, one feature of our concern with conservation and sustainable
development is that we often turn to indigenous peoples for knowledge about how
to use natural resources in ways that provide alternatives to the destructive
and non-sustainable pattern of resource use commonly associated with the
expansion of capitalist production relations.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> A more critical understanding of the costs of
particular patterns of economic growth will undoubtedly yield social as well as
environmental benefits. Similarly, it may well be that the production knowledge
of Native People contains important understanding about the biological bases of
sustainable production systems, as well as about the social and institutional
relations required for them to function. At the same time, efforts to promote
environmental conservation and sustain-</p>

Native People also need to be subject to important caveats. First, the
destructive use of natural resources associated with capitalist economic growth
has been closely linked to struggles over access to land and other resources.
To the extent that conservation and sustainable development efforts fail to
promote institutional arrangements that equitably resolve these conflicts,
their results will be disappointing.<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> Second, as researchers such as Bartra (1992) have
pointed out, Western assumptions about Native People as being close to nature
have more to do with our images of ourselves as being separate from nature than
they do with any particular understanding of the historical context in which
their production systems have developed. If it is true that there are examples
of Native People who offer the hope that their knowledge can be the basis of
sustainable patterns of land management, and who seek to advance their
struggles for land and political autonomy through alliances with international
environmental interests, it is also true that there are many more Native People
who are both major agents and victims of environmental destruction, where
conservation efforts have made environmental destruction worse by ignoring the
historical circumstances that have fostered particular kinds of land use.<sup>4</sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> There are no clear, unequivocal criteria for
classifying specific people as &#8213;indigenous,&#8214; in Latin America, or
elsewhere. Phenomena associated with changing production relations in the
countryside, like rural-urban migration and agrarian reform have often
disrupted customs, the use of indigenous languages, and land tenure relations
that mark and reinforce the ethnic identity. This has increased assimilationist
pressures on all but the most isolated populations. There are no reliable
statistics that measure the numbers of indigenous  populations, or the degree
to which they have been assimilated into the national societies that surround
them. National population censuses are no more than rough guide because many
governments tend to deny that their countries have substantial indigenous
population.<sup>5</sup>  In this context, International Labor Organization
(ILO) Convention No. 169, on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, provides a
description of essential features of indigenous peoples. The declaration
defines as indigenous communities, peoples and nations that have a historical
continuity with the pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on
their territories; and consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the
societies now prevailing on those territories or parts of them. The declaration
also affirms that indigenous peoples represent non-dominant sectors of the
society and are determined to reserve, develop and transmit to future
generations their ancestral territories and their ethnic identity as the basis
of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural
patterns, social institutions and legal systems.<sup><span style='font-size:
9.0pt;line-height:103%'>6 </span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'><sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:103%'> </span></sup>The
ILO declaration associates indigenous peoples with a strong ancestral
attachment to territory and land issues, recognizing that historically most of
them were integrated and subordinated to broader economic and social groupings
within colonial agricultural and mining systems. The subordination of
indigenous peoples as farmers and miners was understood as assimilation to the
predominant economic system, and the outcome of it was to deprive them of their
sociocultural roots. Such assimilation often became a justification for denying
their right to territory defined in terms of their indigenous identity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> The declaration understands indigenous peoples as
integral collectivities, existing within territories, where western
sociocultural and juridical systems prevail, adapting and modifying some of
their patterns in order to survive in an unequal capitalist system. This is
especially important in cases where historical references tell us that the
process by which their territory was appropriated in the name of
&#8213;progress&#8214; and &#8213;development&#8214; signified the
impoverishment and marginalization of the already displaced indigenous people.<sup>7

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'><sup> </sup>It is the distinction between the
individual and collective association of indigenous peoples with economic,
socio-cultural and juridical context that determines whom it is possible to
categorize as indigenous. Indigenous peoples who have been assimilated by the
agricultural system are regarded first as peasants, small farmers or
smallholders. By the same token if they were assimilated economically by the
mining system they are regarded first as miners by governments and other
interested parties. It is the association of indigenous peoples with certain
economic activities that results in the loss of their social, cultural and
juridical systems, upon which rests their collective identification in the
overall society. Understanding the complexity of the definition of indigenous
peoples and assuming that they represent a collectivity as well individuals who
are participants in an economic system, suggests that it is appropriate to
reconsider how they are incorporated into environmental and development projects.<sup>8</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.5pt'> Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (The Earth Summit), which was held in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992,
numerous criticisms of the agreements reached at the conference, and the
progress made on implementing them have been published. Many of these point out
that it is necessary to empower indigenous organization and their
constituencies to achieve the goals that the conference participants set for
themselves. However, it is noteworthy that indigenous organizations and their
constituencies still are marginal participants in the substantive discussions
involving international and national fora. While indigenous people are regular
participants in international environmental meetings, their relationships to
collective organizations that are actually involved in managing territories and
other indigenous lands are weak. This makes it difficult for the people
attempting to represent indigenous people in such ditions of their
participation in the international market. This will require direct
strengthening of grassroots indigenous organizations, and the definition of
mechanisms for their participation, not only in projects to be implemented, but
in the definition of the environmental and development problems to be
addressed. Otherwise, the social conflicts that have driven us to the current
environmental crisis may be made worse by our ef-</p>

so many that he has had several opportunities to spot his Ghana <i>kente</i>
piece that our family presented to him in Louisiana. In summing up his honors,
they have for example included being awarded honorary degrees by USA-based and
overseas academic institutions and, also, being selected by the erstwhile
Organization for African Unity (OAU) (now known as the African Union or AU) to
serve as an Eminent Statesman of Africa, whereby he and other selected eminent
Africans meet to dialogue and offer useful pieces of advice on delineated
issues to African leaders. Although he is not known to be a radical scholar,
with rhetorical socialist bent, Dr. Mazrui has still teamed up with other
anti-apartheid and anti-colonialism forces, including the late Professor Dennis
Brutus of South Africa to fight against apartheid and other unequal treatment
of fellow Africans in colonial and post-colonial Africa. All of these
appreciable dimensions have made Dr. Mazrui a true champion of fair-play as
well as a meaningful scholar, whose writings and Radio/TV commentaries have
contributed immensely to the decolonization struggles of such African
nationalist and liberation movements as ANC, SWAPO, FRELIMO, among others. </p>

2.65pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>While, we were collaborating on
writing our thoughts about Mwalimu (Nana) Mazrui in this essay, we still had
the urge at the back of our minds about him to the point of asking, as Paul
Theroux, the expert on travelogues, recently did in <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i>
(January 2011): &#8213;Do I write my life [story], or leave it to others to
deal with?&#8214; Theroux eventually cited Henry James as describing
biographers as &#8213;post-mortem exploiters.&#8214; We wonder what Professor
Mazrui too thinks about that because we strongly feel that his autobiography
will stay on <i>the New York Times’ </i>best seller list for a long time, and
it will be an essential reading for all. Otherwise, as Theroux wrote in <i>The
Smithsonian Magazine</i>, we also borrow from Kipling the following poetic
words, as we wait for Dr.  Mazrui‘s published memoirs to be shared with us:  </p>

interestingly, Professor Mazrui does not concentrate his intellectual and
professional benevolence in Africa. In fact, when Guyana‘s educational leaders
saw it fit to inaugurate Walter Rodney Professorship on the Guyana campus of
the University of Guyana, it was Mazrui to whom they turned, thereby making him
the inaugural Walter Rodney Professor. He traveled all the way to Georgetown,
Guyana, for the inaugural festivities; holding positions for several years, he
retired from them in 1999. Also, to propagate African studies and scholarship,
Professor Mazrui has traveled far and wide as well as held visiting
professorships and lectureships in many countries, including Canada, Singapore,
Pakistan, USA, Iran, Ghana, Tanzania, UK and Germany, among others. </p>

.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:16.55pt'>Finally, friends as well as admirers
alike, colleagues and even critics of Professor Ali Al‘amin Mazrui would agree
that one day, he will slow down and, in doing so, to reduce his day-today work
load as a man in his 70s is expected by society to do and, in the process, take
time to reflect meaningfully on his overall life‘s journey in what each aging
mortal knows as a retirement. Furthermore, it is also not impossible that he
can, as well, become an ancestor at the end of his life‘s journey. Whenever he
faces either of the two occasions or prospects of life, our beloved Dr. <i>Nana</i>
(<i>Mwalimu </i>or Professor) Mazrui can still take solace in the words that
have befittingly been inscribed on the tombstone of the late Reverend Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., who toiled for America‘s downtrodden as well as the

He is working on a series of papers that address the relationship between peace
agreements and the durability of peace. He investigates how the design quality
of the peace agreement, and the structural and procedural provisions it
contains, influence cooperation between erstwhile belligerents. The first
paper, which examines the durability of peace in the aftermath of intrastate
armed conflicts, will be presented at the annual conference of the Midwest
Political Science Association. The second paper, which focuses on human rights
provisions, will be presented at the annual conference of the American
Political Science Association. </p>
