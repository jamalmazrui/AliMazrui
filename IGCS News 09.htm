4.4pt;margin-left:.7pt;text-indent:.25in'>The year 2011 also marked the 20th
anniversary of Ali Mazrui’s confirmation as Director of the newly-established
Institute of Global Cultural Studies (IGCS) at the State University of New York
at Binghamton. When Ali Mazrui was appointed two years earlier (1989) as Albert
Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities for Binghamton, he was allowed to retain
concurrently for two years his prior professorship in Political Science at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. It was not until 1991 that Ali Mazrui
resigned from the University of Michigan and confirmed his long-term
affiliation to SUNYBinghamton. The Institute of Global Cultural Studies (IGCS)
was inaugurated soon after. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
4.35pt;margin-left:.7pt;text-indent:.25in'>This convergence of Mazruiana
anniversaries was celebrated at the 54th annual meeting of the African Studies
Association (ASA) of the United States in Washington, DC in November 2011. The
theme of the 2011 ASA annual meeting was itself a celebration of 50 years of
Africa’s independence from colonial rule. During the period of the annual
meeting two round-tables were organized. The morning round-table on December
19, 2011 brought together Professor S. Nyang (Howard University), Professor R.
Laremont (Binghamton University), Professor Assie-Lumumba (Cornell University),
Professor A. Adebajo (Center for Conflict resolution Cape Town, South Africa,
Chair) and Professor C. Butterworth (University of Maryland). The participants
in the afternoon round-table on the same day were Professor A. Irele (Harvard
Universit), Professor J. Mittelman (American University), Professor T. Shaw
(University of London, Chair) and Professor S. Adem (Binghamton University).
All participants reflected on the career and scholarship of Professor Ali A.
Mazrui, and it is expected that the International Institute of Islamic Thought
(IIIT) would financially support the publication of a book based upon the
papers presented at the roundtables. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
4.4pt;margin-left:.7pt;text-indent:.25in'>Also at the annual meeting IIIT
awarded Ali Mazrui the <i>Ismail Al Faruqi Distinguished Scholar Award</i> in
recognition of Mazrui’s “lifetime achievements as a scholar activist.” The
ceremony was held at the Marriot Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, DC. Apart
from tributes and the presentation of the award, the ceremony included an
exhibition of Mazruiana memorabilia (biographical photographs, certificates,
awards, etc.). There was also a 25 minute documentary about Mazrui’s life,
filmed and shown by Professor David Ndirangu Wachanga, of the University of
Wisconsin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:.7pt;text-indent:.25in'>Perhaps the most intriguing
coincidence of all was that in the year 2011 Kenya (Mazrui’s country of birth)
adopted a new Constitution which for the first time recognized dual
nationality. The new Constitution therefore opened the door for Ali Mazrui to apply
for US citizenship without necessarily relinquishing his Kenyan nationality.
Ali Mazrui has now started the process of pursuing that option. Ali Mazrui has

src="IGCS%20News%2009_files/image007.jpg" align=left hspace=12> About four
decades ago, when I was an impressionable undergraduate student, I learned from
Mwalimu that intellectual hot potatoes could be handled in original ways. The
habit of not always following the beaten path in thinking or the established
order of things fascinated me. On the occasion when so many special tributes
were being paid to him as part of the African Studies Association (ASA)
convention events, I chose to speak about three of his actions which I thought
were his most successful failures. The risk which I took in seeking permission
from the organizers to let me do so turned out to also be a risk for them to
take. I was saved when Ali, in his extraordinary sense of humor gave the
go-ahead. In doing this, however, Mwalimu now tipped the balance leaving the
entire risk on me. I took refuge in the fact that my mentor is the Director of
the Institute of Global Cultural Studies (IGCS) and went ahead with this
unorthodox adventure which I present in the following paragraphs.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Mwalimu Ali Mazrui’s first — and perhaps the greatest
— failure was what he did in Mombasa, Kenya on February 24, 1933. Arriving on
planet earth that day, little Ali, immediately precipitated a cultural
linguistic controversy in Europe between the English and the French. It is not
only driving on the wrong sides of the road that separates these two cousin
nations from each other. For the French, the child is the subject — i.e., the
actor in the verb from which the noun “birth” is derived. In other words, Ali
himself “came into the world” (<i>il naquit le 24 févfier en 1933</i>). As for
the English, on the other hand, at birth the child itself is inactive and
therefore merely an object since it is born by someone — i.e., the mother who
is therefore the subject. Having lived for thirty years in France since 1981, I
now like the French, see the child as the actor in this matter. Fortunately,
Professor Mazrui himself writes that (the) <i>French and British traders alike
married Indian women . . . and both were able to adapt themselves to Indian
ways of life and the Indian manner of thinking. . . .</i><sup>1</sup> It was
therefore little Ali himself who failed to arrive as a person who could be
neatly fitted into one given human group — ethnic, cultural or racial. He could
not belong or be caged into any one sectarian kind. This was because baby Ali
chose to arrive with parents from more than one human group — a black African
mother and an Arab father from the Arabian Peninsula! By his act of birth, Ali
failed to be a person of one “pure” race. With this significant failure, little
Ali was ironically predisposed to growing up into the caliber of Kenyan,
African, Arab and </p>

Washington, DC in November 2011. The reverse side of that huge failure is
Mwalimu’s extraordinary cascade of successes. It also partly explains why Ali
is a human bridge between and among divergent human societies, nations and
continents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
7.75pt;margin-left:1.2pt'>  About three decades later, more exactly 28 years
after, another boy child arrived just like little Ali did — fusing two
continents, races and countries into one: that little child is today the
world’s most powerful political figure under the sun in whose veins, like in
those of Professor Mazrui, runs fifty percent of black African blood —
President Barack Obama. In both cases, the maternal side had the preponderant
influence as both sons adopted the countries of their mothers for citizenship:
Ali Mazrui is Kenyan and Barack Obama is American. For failing to fit into the
African/Arab/</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:14.55pt;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'>White American traditions — (Ali and Barack should have
respectively been Arab [from Oman] and Kenyan from Africa) according to the
patrilineal practice, they were able to be something else — an African and an
American.  Yet these two blood Kenyans, East Africans, Africans are just as
truly blood brothers to the inhabitants of North Africa and the Middle East and
the rest of the world. The success in the apparent failure is that Mwalimu and
the American President have the unique independence and openness of mind which
is a vital talent necessary in relating with others across racial, religious
and ideological divides. In the case of Professor Ali Mazrui, two of his lauded
works<sup>2</sup> particularly bear testimony to this. With this background one
is able to understand how and why the concept of “<i>a triple heritage</i>”
occurred to Professor Ali Mazrui at the peak of his quest for <i>Africanness </i>in
our time<i>.</i>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
7.75pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Born controversial, three decades later, in 1963 Ali
did his second and maybe most objectionable act — traditionally, religiously
and politically a troubling failure. An African, at that age, Ali, to rise to
the social rank of a man, decided to take a wife. It was exactly on this point
that he failed. A Kenyan of his generation, one of the few elites and therefore
those expected to symbolically reflect the resolute nationalistic resistance to
all things British, colonial or just white authority in the spirit of the <i>Mau
Mau</i> war of liberation, Ali failed to embrace </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:14.55pt;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'>bitterness, hate, vengefulness and the racial
undercurrent associated with these sentiments among Kenyans. Instead of
choosing an African girl or any other kind of partner, he decided to marry a
white English woman. To add pain to injury, although himself a Muslim, Ali went
for a </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> With hindsight, however, the heap of apparent failures
connected with Mwalimu’s nonconformity with the established order manifested in
marriages, becomes evidence of his tremendous capacity in confronting huge
personal and professional challenges in his later life. About a decade later in
the seventies up to the end of the 20th century this was to come true. Like
with his birth, precisely in the logic of his nature, Ali was acting
preemptively vis-à-vis distant challenges. The unclassifiable child when he arrived,
Ali now acted in defiance of the received reductionist patriotism or cultural
taboos. The racial, religious and ideological chains of the time did not manage
to check his action. Was Mwalimu not resisting at all levels and therefore
being a visionary as a man? From the spiritual level, Ali a Muslim black man
from the oppressed Kenyan society marrying a woman from the white Christian
British society could only be understood if one embraced the biblical
admonition “<i>You have heard that it was said, </i>‘<i>Love your neighbor and
hate your enemy.</i>’<i> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those
who persecute you.</i>”<sup>3</sup> In this, as a man, Ali the Muslin took the
stride to live the Gospel according to Saint Matthew. As for crossing the
racial divide, he emulated his own father from Oman, who had done so with an
African woman, his mother — only that in the case of Mwalimu Ali Mazrui, he was
embracing the enemy society the colonizers who had committed atrocities on his
own Kenyan people. This time Ali was now acting with the same rare visionary
power of <i>Emanuel</i>, the hero in book <i>Governeurs de la Rosée</i>, by
Jacques Roumain, the venerated Haïtian writer during the first part of the 20th
century. Indeed, Ali’s Molly was Emmanuel’s <i>Annaïse</i>, our heroine here.  
In his great lectures, written (or electronic) works, Mwalimu has rarely
directly preached reconciliation, tolerance, peace or love towards those we
consider repugnant. Knowing Ali personally, however, I have consistently
noticed him silently but powerfully sending these messages. Like Emmanuel, the
hero cited above, Professor Ali Mazrui’s valuable work at the human level is
quiet and discrete, detected only by those who are close, sensitive and
informally in touch with him. Snaps taken of him occasionally give this away. 
Each one of Mwalimu’s big failures almost always leads him to greater heights,
throwing him into more trouble. His third most successful failure arose from an
incident linked to his intellectual fearlessness and relentless advocacy for
freedom of expression on the African continent. From the onset one should
congratulate Ali on this third failure because it was inextricably tied to his
second one. Professor Ali Mazrui at Makerere University in Uganda was publicly
well-known for two habits. First, he often went off the campus and addressed
civil society gatherings on all kinds of sensitive subjects. This also included
his going outside Uganda to other countries. Secondly, on such occasions, when
the time came for him to enter the hall where he was going to address people,
he ceremoniously walked in, and down the aisle holding his wife’s hand like
“bride and bridegroom” approaching platform. Enthusiastic cheers and applaud
filled the hall welcoming Ali Mazrui and Molly — the Afro-European couple. 
Pan-African Ali Mazrui knew that his contribution to the self-esteem of all
Africans and particularly of South Africa’s black people was a duty. Therefore,
on being invited by the Universities of Cape Town and Witwatersrand to address
similar gatherings in that country he accepted although he put to his hosts —
the organizers three conditions which, only if met would he go to apartheid-
ruled South Africa. These were the following: 1) he should be able to say
whatever he wanted, 2) he should be able to address racially mixed audiences,
and 3) he should be able to go with his wife.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Ali Mazrui deliberately included the last condition to
keenly test the apartheid system at its most sensitive point. As what has been
said above will have shown, this is a point of strength Ali Mazrui had gained a
decade earlier by failing to marry a fellow black or colored person. Now he was
in a position to deliver a crucial message to the South African apartheid
authorities, to Africa as a continent and to the world-at-large on the
senselessness of practicing racial segregation. The question, however, is
whether Professor Ali Mazrui succeeded or failed in this confrontation. He
stuck to his principles and pride as laid down in the conditions under which he
would go to South Africa. Under no circumstances would he be separated from his
wife as the apartheid rules in South Africa would require. Exchanges between
the organizers in Cape Town and Professor Mazrui followed as described below.  
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> The conference organizers informed Professor Ali
Mazrui that he was putting to them conditions which were difficult to satisfy
given the laws in force within South Africa under the apartheid government.
They nevertheless explained that they would try to have the first condition
granted by the authorities. On the second, although they were not optimistic,
they at least promised to try and see what the results would be. As for the
third condition, the organizers informed Ali without any ambiguity that they were
not even going to try. This, they knew, according to the official practice, if
the black and white couple turned up, the police would arrest them on arrival.
In the face of this Ali decided not go to South Africa. This, then, was Ali’s
third big successful failure — or was it?  On closer reflection this may in
fact have been one of Professor Mazrui’s political victories vis-à-vis the
racist apartheid regime in Pretoria. He later used the incident to write an
article in the Commonwealth Report scathingly criticizing Prime Minister Jon
Foster’s government for the racial discrimination, lack of intellectual freedom
or free speech, inter alia. The criticism was brought to Mr. Jon Foster’s
attention. In a face saving effort, the South African Prime Minister had a
letter written to </p>

to travel to South Africa with the assurances that nothing of the kind would
happen to the couple. Ali’s action in 1963, of marrying a white woman brought
him to lock horns with the powerful racist authorities of South Africa. What
radical Africans had looked at as Ali’s failure a decade earlier had become the
strongest silent way to challenge the apartheid system. Ali and Molly stood as
an eloquent political and cultural symbol of the oneness and strength of the
human race. What is more, between them Ali and Molly brought into the world

.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> The intellectual relevance of Dr. Ali Mazrui has been
variously noted, his scholarly preoccupation that is, Africa, its place and
destiny in the wider global system, called <i>Mazruiana</i>, could be said to
have gained international attention through this documentary. The focus on
Africa as exemplified in  this work is not a mere (re)affirmation of things
Africa, or a collection of endangered practices for the amusement of curiosity
seekers, rather it is in a sense the uncovering of Africa’s foundational
constitution in which are inscribed, perhaps, enshrined its creeds, values,
aspirations, and institutions. This spiritual and social pact between the
people, their gods and nature is an invaluable admixture the crux of which is
integral to Africans’ identity formation. In contact situations, aspect of this
fulcrum of being for Africans interacts with non-African influences, while
remaining aspects of this core are sheltered and jealously guarded. Thus, in
recognition of its stable, solid core works on Africa speak of the resilience
of African cultures. The application of the phrase resilience seems acceptable
in so far as it refers to this indestructible crucible of African make-up.  
The indelible consciousness for this African core was first raised for me by the
documentary, <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i>. It has been twentyfive
years since it was made, nevertheless the theoretical, instructional appeal of
this work has not ceased, neither has its pedagogical relevance abated. For me,
this documentary marked a defining moment of confrontation with Africa, its
history, its present, its place in the globe, and its future. This documentary
is for me and perhaps for the narrator, Professor Ali Mazrui a journey toward
self-evaluation, of discovery, and cognizing of one’s own wealth in the form of
history, indigenous cultural institutions and societal organization. But first,
some aside comments.  The global exposure that this work gave and still gives
to Africa remains remarkable, it is an invaluable documentary that introduces
Africa, explicates and diagnoses the continent and its various institutions
with intellectual rigor. This work is a great landmark of historiography and
cultural study of the continent. Unlike many works with the pretentious tag
“Africa” the documentary is a thorough analysis of the continent. Its scope, as
has become most of Mazrui’s work, truly spans the continent, illustrating every
region and significant institutions. It looks into history to understand the
present; through comparative analyses it makes sense of then contemporary
Africa and thence explores its future. In fact, it is a thorough synopsis of
the continent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

arguably his template towards global studies. His scholarship since then has
not been bound to a continent, rather, his theoretical positions find
illustrations across the globe. Thus, issues of democracy, economic development
and religious understanding are not only of concern to </p>

Professor Mazrui has since transitioned to a global scholarship, using Africa
as his point of departure.  A piece of this kind, given the occasion, is often
replete with celebratory language and adulatory tone. This work deserves both,
as does the narrator, Dr. Mazrui, for his insightful theoretical frameworks,
his methodology and the aptness of his observations which have continued to
inspire generations of scholars. As one of those who have profited from this
documentary in terms of personal scholarly development and one who finds it
invaluable in teaching an undergraduate course on peoples and cultures of
Africa, the documentary has a personal and professional value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> There are memorable instructional moments where
individuals, in the course of their intellectual growth, have to confront
certain unexamined childhood preconceptions that have been neatly tucked away.
Such moments require a person to take a stand that ultimately shreds such
innocent assumptions. For Prof. Maurice Amutabi, this moment occurred when he
was researching images of women in advertisement. As a child Maurice accepted
as real, authentic and factual anyone that shows up on TV. Thus, for him actors
including those in commercials, and their messages were just as real as
President Moi, because they occupied the same space in the tube.<sup>1</sup>
Professor Toyin Falola illustrated various examples of these moments in his
memoir<sup>2</sup> with respect to polygamy, communal Yoruba lifestyle and
gerontocracy. For Wole Soyinka, whose memoir,<sup>3</sup> similar to Falola’s
is an adult’s reminiscence of childhood, it was confrontation with the world
larger than the family and with the life of grown-ups. In all these cases, this
point of confrontation becomes transformational and accompanied by a change in
perspective. For me, this moment with respect to Africa, dates to the initial
viewing of Ali Mazrui’s <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i>. I will describe
just two defining outcomes from the viewing of this documentary (a)
demystifying the source of knowledge (b) empowerment to contribute to
scholarship on Africa. </p>

Europeans teaching the natives about themselves, but teaching the “natives”
about themselves he certainly is and he has authenticating footages. Like all
the Europeans before him, he cuts the image of an eye witness, walking,
pointing, knowing and telling in a convincing manner. The illumination from
each of the eight episodes; enhanced by compelling historical underpinnings of
the various issues that feature in each segment, gave force of truism and reality
to the discourse.  The sudden realization of the ability of Africans to shed
lights of significance on epoch-defining moments of their civilization and the
fact of their rights to document, declare and explicate their own stories were
greatly impressed on me. I suddenly realized more so than before that none is
marked the onset of my personal journey in gaining closer familiarity with the
continent. As Bob Marley wailed, “<i>if you know your history, then you would
know where you’re coming from. . . .</i>”<sup>4  </sup>Consequently, it was
interesting to hear Prof. Mazrui affirm that Christians and Christian
ceremonies were in existence in Ethiopia well before it reached England and to
wonder along with him why we mainly hear of European missionary activities to
Africa, but never of African origin of Christianity. Actually, there is no
African origin of any worthy element of modernization and civilization. Yet,
Christian monastery was first developed in Africa. Scholars in Ethiopia were
reading and writing earlier than in England. The concept of a single god is one
of the major contributions of Africa that is least acknowledged. . . . It was
instructive to hear narconnection between the emergence of Islamic
fundamentalism and the clash of cultures which manifests politically with the
assassination of President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, conflicts of independence, in
fact there seem not to be any internal or local conflict, rather, each is
internationalized as exemplified by the Nigerian-Biafran war or Mozambique’s
civil war. The much vaunted developmental projects such as the Akosombo Dam
that was billed as a catalyst for modernization and development, turned out to
be a mere instrument of imperialism. </p>

honor at the Marriot Hotel, Wardman Park in November — Washington, DC.    The
world today and Africa in particular — more critically than ever before needs
role models in every field of endeavor. Leadership, whether political,
economic, cultural, intellectual or scientific — must be based on unbiased,
informed and tolerant understanding of others’ concerns. Professor Ali Mazrui
protected by his ancestors’ blessings and by the Creator has devoted his entire
life over the last half-a-century researching, teaching and analyzing human
crises of all kinds. Mwalimu was professor in 1968 when I first met him as a
college student in Uganda. Working on the General History of Africa at United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1989,
Mwalimu used to squeeze a time and listen to me! He would even come home to see
the grandchildren. Ali invariably brought greetings and news of his first wife
Molly, my teacher of French, and about the children. We talked about faith,
family life and only turned to world issues afterwards. A brother, mentor and
friend shared with me how to be open to other cultures and civilization on
earth.    Mwalimu’s life helped me discover that events or things must not be
judged on their face value. The saying “A blessing in disguise” runs throughout
what I have written about Ali’s life. Failures aren’t exactly what they may
appear to be at first.         &#9650; </p>

become not just indigenized but rejuvenated on the continent. Scholars like
Rimi Nwariboko, Caleb Oladipo and Asonzeh Ukah continue to document the growth
of Christianity on the continent and its outward spread. In fact, as of 2011,
Africa’s greatest export to the rest of the world is perhaps Christianity with
its distinct African flair and religiosity. Islam continues to rise unabated,
especially its effort towards political domination. This is attested by the
violence in Somalia, terrorist activities in Northern Nigeria by the Boko Harem
and by the performances of the Islamic Brotherhood in elections in the recently
liberated Egypt and the institution of Islamic government by the interim
government of Libya. African traditional religion on the other hand may not be
spectacular in visibility; it remains the core-belief system and mark of
identification for most Africans. The cultural primacy of traditional Africa
and its importance to solving Africa’s problems is perhaps the most overlooked
resources in Africa. Western cultural influence remains in my opinion poorly
grafted appendage to African institutions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> The quality and rate of African production attest to
the industrial and technological impact of the West on it. Twenty-five years
ago, the documentary lamented the crude state of industrial production as well
as the decaying political, health, social and economic institutions on the
continent show the shallowness of the relationship. Twenty-five years after
this documentary, it is not clear that a new documentary will attest to
anything different in these regards.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

target in the liberation of Africa. When enslavement ended, colonialism
replaced it, colonialism ended, neo-colonialism replaced it, economic
exploitation, accumulation of debt, intellectual enslavement, and cultural
reorientation each creeps one following the other. This piecemeal emergence and
sequential resolution of problems continue to foster dependence on the West.
Essentially, one wonders when Africans will seize the initiatives, stop reacting
to events orchestrated elsewhere and become truly independent. It is
interesting to note that as Ali Mazrui decries various neocolonial policies,
the effects of westernization and external influences on the continent, his
credits, based on nomenclature, did not include African names; ranging from the
researchers for the documentary, the technical crew, to the sponsors. It would
seem that imperialism and neocolonialism that Africans decry are only to the
extent that imperialists make it possible to be heard. Let us hope that a
sequel will not be inspired by outsiders but will be informed and directed by
internal African considerations, creativity </p>

after the March 2011 mega earthquake, the subsequent tsunami and nuclear
radiations.  Japan is the third largest economy in the world — after the United
States and China. And yet the ideational elements, or the philosophical
underpinnings, of this power are less well-known. Japan’s economy has indeed
been the subject of considerable scholarly scrutiny over the years, but we know
that the same cannot be said about Japan’s culture, or the relationship between
the two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> But, why do scholars generally tend to pay relatively
little attention to cultural explanations of social and economic behavior? One
likely answer would have to do with the problem of measuring culture and
systematically relating it to behavioral changes. Cultural behavior cannot
readily be observed; it has to be deduced from the spoken word and overt
actions. This also makes it difficult, theoretically, to formulate and
empirically test the relationship between culture and behavior. Another thing
which “frightens scholars” who seek to use a cultural approach relates to “the
sulfuric odor of race and inheritance” that inherently accompanies it. Whatever
the fundamental reason that discouraged scholars from cultural </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'>analysis of behavior is, the consequence had been the
slighting of the role of culture in society.   Thus, I wish to inquire here
briefly about how culture shaped Japan’s economic organization and how it made
the Japanese system of thought what it is. Let us start by asking a simple and
straightforward question: Could Japan boast of an ideology of its own? Some say
Japan does not have anything unique of its own in the form of original ideas
since virtually every aspect of Japanese achievement is itself the result of
imitation.  With some dramatization, J. Tobin summarized this view succinctly:
“. . . the Japanese, unable or unwilling to create, borrow. The genius of the
Japanese lies not in invention but in adaptation — of Korean pottery, tombs and
textiles; Chinese script and scripture; Dutch science and medicine; French
education; English colonialism; German militarism; and American egalitarianism,
corporate efficiency and popular culture.”<i> </i>There are also those who
insist that Japan is so unique from the rest of the world in fundamental ways
that it could offer an attractively powerful model that is worthy of emulating.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> But, a broad consensus exists that Japanese are
culturally flexible people; they have the ability to change course quickly in
response to the needs of the times, rather than stubbornly clinging on.  Ruth
Benedict has observed: “The Japanese sees that he has made an ‘error’ in
embarking a course of action which does not achieve its goal.  When it fails,
he discards it as a lost cause, for he is not conditioned to pursue lost
causes.  ‘It is no use,’ he says, ‘biting one’s navel.’” The views are far from
uniform, however, when it comes to the extent to which cultural flexibility
contributed to the rapid industrialization and economic development of Japan. 
This is where the issue of imitation also should enter the discussion. It is
evident that Japanese give more value to imitation (adaptation or
domestication, as some would prefer to put it) than to invention. And
successful imitation is undoubtedly a virtue rather than a vice, irrespective
of the society in which it takes place.  History of nations reaffirms that
there is no civilization that had risen to pre-eminence without borrowing ideas
from another civilization. Japanese are good imitators and excellent modifiers
of what has been imitated. An example of a foreign idea that had been modified
to fit domestic purpose is Confucianism. Confucius regarded benevolence,
justice, ceremony, knowledge and faith as among the most important virtues, but
believed out of these it was benevolence which was the virtue that should be at
the heart of humanity. In Japan, loyalty, rather than benevolence, became the
most important virtue. </p>

about the underlying root of and the general attitude towards imitation in
Japan: “At the core of the Japanese culture lies the idea that imitation is an
important process of basic education. The word <u>manabu</u> (to learn) and <u>maneru</u>
(to imitate) are said to have derived from the same origin, <u>manaberu</u>,
and students and apprentices are often told to flow their masters’ models
before they acquire their own ideas and skills. Nor do Japanese always
distinguish between imitation and creation. Rather, they regard practical
application of science and requirements of prototypes of technology as no less
creative than discoveries and inventions.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Similarly, the fundamental distinction between the
Japanese system of thought and that of the West has made Japanese “capitalism”
work in ways neither Adam Smith nor Karl Marx would have easily understood. One
such distinction could perhaps be illustrated by taking a brief contrastive
look at the ideas of Adam Smith and Shosan Suzuki, a European political
economist and a Japanese monk, respectively. One of the well-known and
distinguishing features of Adam Smith’s idea is the deep suspicion with which merchants
and manufacturers are viewed. In Smith’s own well-known words:  “It is not from
the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our
dinner but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to
their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our
necessities but of their advantages.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Shosan Suzuki is regarded by some as the man most
directly responsible for the development of “capitalism” in Japan, and Suzuki’s
idea is the obverse of Adam Smith. In a clear attempt to morally justify a
“worldly activity,” Suzuki wrote: “All is for the good of the world. . . The
all encompassing Buddha-nature manifests in us all works for the world’s good;
without artisans, such as the blacksmith, there would be no tools; without
officials there would be no order; without farmers there would be no food; without
merchants, we would suffer inconvenience. All the other occupations as well are
for the good of the world.” In fact, Suzuki went as far as to assert: “. . .
commerce is the function Heaven has assigned to those whose </p>

rapid industrialization of Japan, historian Takeo Kuwabara had argued: “Over
all Japan’s myriad gods and deities, there is no single Allah or Jehovah, no
monopolistic god that devours all the others. One all-powerful god would not
permit constant shifting from one thing to another. For a Japanese, one
all-knowing god would be constricting. When one does something uncommendable,
he may hide it from his wife, children and other people, but if that god was
above him, he would be uneasy. . . That god would scold when he caught someone
beating a drum as a Nichiren Buddhist one day and singing hymns at church the
next . . . As it is, none of Japan’s thousands of gods has too much power. As
the old maxim goes, ‘If one god throws you, another god will pick you up’ . . .
I believe that the absence of an almighty God was instrumental in that
success.”  At least insofar as the instrumentality of religious values is
assumed to be crucial for economic success, Max Weber’s argument bears a
striking similarity to that of Takeo Kuwabara. Kuwabara’s thesis could be also
seen as the Weberian theory <i>in reverse</i>. Referring to the difference in
the attitudes of different religions toward economic life, Max Weber quotes, in
his famous book, <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, a
succinct characterization by a contemporary writer: “The Catholic is quieter,
having less of the acquisitive impulse; he prefers a life of the greatest
possible security, even with the smaller income, to a life of risk and
excitement, even though it may bring the chance of gaining honor and riches.
The proverb says jokingly, ‘either eat well or sleep well.’ In the present
case, the Protestant prefers to eat well, the Catholic to sleep undisturbed.” 
While Weber viewed Protestantism as fostering economic development by
inculcating certain favorable values in people’s minds, Kuwabara believed
commitment to any particular religion is restrictive and undermines
flexibility. J. Taylor has further elaborated the Japanese attitude towards
monotheism: “The reason why Japanese balk at Christianity is that it demands
exclusive loyalty. If the demands of the community are in conflict with the
demands of God, Christianity teaches men to follow God. This takes great
courage in any society but it is part of the Western mythology about individual
autonomy. For the Japanese, it is well nigh unthinkable to forsake the group
for a principle, no matter how deeply felt.” Moreover Weber’s account of the
emergence of capitalism, especially in reference to Luther’s conception of the <i>calling</i>,
seems to echo Suzuki’s philosophical elevation of commercial activity. It is in
this way that success in attaining worldly “good” is stressed in Japanese
mythology and philosophy.                &#9650; </p>

Africa. Located in the center of southern Africa, Botswana is bordered by South
Africa on the east and south, Namibia on the west and north, and Zimbabwe on
the northeast, and it touches Zambia along the Zambezi River. Occupying an area
of nearly 582,000 square kilometers, Botswana is similar in size to the US
State of Texas, or the Republic of Kenya. The Okavango River, one of southern
Africa’s longest rivers flows through Botswana, fanning out into a huge inland
delta some 15,000 square kilometers in area, to form a unique environment with
a myriad of water channels. The Kalahari (or Kgalagadi) desert occupies
approximately eighty percent of the country, with valleys and pans etched
across the landscape. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Botswana’s large area seems out of proportion to its
population of just two million people. More than a third of the population
lives in a corridor that runs north and south in the eastern portion of the
country, where rainfall is most abundant and the water supply is permanent,
land is arable, and infrastructure is more developed. Although, Botswana’s
government has maintained a firm commitment to policies that make no
distinctions along ethnic or racial lines, the country is ethnically diverse.
There are eight major Setswanaspeaking groups, a large non-Setswana-speaking
language group, the Bakalanga speakers, followed by the San or Basarwa (usually
referred to as Bushmen), who speak Khoi-San languages and other smaller groups.
There is a significant Damara or Baherero population, who fled Namibia, in
1905, when it was under German rule. There are also significant numbers of
citizens of European, Asian and mixed descent, as well as a large temporary
expatriate community.  Before the entrance of Tswana herders, the area that
became Botswana was sparsely populated by hunter and gatherer communities of
the San people. The Tswana began to enter the country in the early 16th
century, but a major Tswana displacement from South Africa occurred during the
early 18th century, as a consequence of the Zulu wars. British missionaries
arrived to Tswana territory in the 19th century. In the late 1800s, when
hostilities broke out between the Tswana and the Transvaal Boer settlers who
were invading Tswana lands, the Tswana chiefs appealed to the British for
protection. In 1885, the British put Tswana territory under their protection,
through the creation of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. </p>

shops were scattered along the single railway track line built by the British
South Africa Company to link the Cape Colony with Southern Rhodesia. The
Protectorate had twenty kilometers of paved road and the rest of the road
network consisted of dirt tracks. This poor economic and social landscape began
to change a year after Botswana’s independence, in 1966, when gemquality
diamonds were discovered at Orapa (Harvey and Lewis 1990: 15; Mogalakwe 1997:
25–26).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Botswana soon became one of the world’s top diamond
producers, and the country’s per capita gross national product (GNP) expanded
from less than US$ 100, in 1966, to over US$ 7,500 by 2009. Politically,
Botswana is one of the most stable constitutional democracies in southern
Africa. Presidential elections are held on schedule every five years. The
presidential has executive power and is chosen by national election. The
cabinet is selected by the President from the members of the National Assembly,
which has forty elected and four appointed members. The authority of the Chiefs
was formally recognized under the constitution through the creation of the
House of Chiefs as part of the legislative branch of government. The House of
Chiefs represents the eight principal sub-groups of the Botswana ethnic
composition, and four other members are selected by the sub-chiefs of four of
the districts. Chiefs and other leaders preside over customary and traditional
courts, but within the constitutional government, the role of the House of
Chiefs is strictly advisory (Tlou and Campbell 1984: 231).  Botswana’s
post-independence economic success is exceptional, considering that it has
occurred in a context of a liberal democratic political order, and in a
regional context where independence struggles, threats of invasion, and in
particular the disruptive influence of apartheid South Africa, were constant
menaces for its political and economic stability (Thomson 2000: 101–103).
Botswana’s liberal democratic political order makes it worthwhile to revisit
historical political events and remember the role that key political figures
played during the pre-independence negotiations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> One of the key political figures was Sir Seretse
Khama, the Bangwato chiefdom heir, and future prime minister of independent
Botswana. Sir Seretse Khama was the son of Segoma II and grandson of Khama III,
both former chiefs of the Bangwato chiefdom. Born in 1921, he became
chief-designate at the age of four, on the death of his father. His uncle
Tshekedi Khama ruled the chiefdom as regent until he reached the age of
majority. He was educated at Lovedale Institution in the Cape Province of South
Africa, Fort Hare University College, and University of the Witwatersrand in
South Africa, then in Britain at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1946 he joined the
Inner Temple in London, to study to become a barrister. In 1948, he married a
white Englishwoman, Ruth Williams. The marriage was condemned at tribal
meetings, and, in 1950, the British Government decided to withhold recognition
of Khama as the Bangwato chief. For the South African government and the white
population, Khama’s marriage was an outrageous event, and it served as a
pretext for demanding once more the transfer of the High Commission Territories
to the Union of South Africa, as was provided for in the 1910 Act to constitute
the Union of South Africa. The South Africa Act formed the Union of South Africa
from the British Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Orange River, Natal and
Transvaal, and provided for the possible future incorporation of the three High
Commission Territories (Bechuanaland, Swazi- land, and Lesotho) and Rhodesia,
subject to consultation with their populations. Rhodesia rejected incorporation
in a referendum, but South Africa demanded that the High Commission Territories
be incorporated without consultation, and used Khama’s marriage to Williams as
a justification. To satisfy the South African demand, the British banned Khama
from Bechuanaland for five years, but this did not placate the calls for
incorporation, leading the British to seek appeasement by making Khama’s ban
indefinite. Khama’s banning provoked protests and riots within the Bangwato
chiefdom, and prominent members of the Bangwato aristocracy mobilized forming
the Bangwato National Congress (BNC). The BNC stood for Khama’s reinstallation
as Bangwato chief and for democratic reform in the Protectorate (Morton and
Ramsay 1987: 129–130). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> The political unrest that Khama’s marriage and
banishment had provoked coincided with other denunciations of South Africa’s
apartheid policies in international fora in Britain and the United Nations by
African nationalist leaders. The international attention forced the South
African government to reconsider the political consequences that could arise
from having its image damaged internationally by continuing to insist on the
transfer issue. For example, strains its relations with Britain and other European
countries, could damage South African economic interests in the region (Parsons
et al. 1995; Dutfiel 1990).  In 1956, Seretse Khama returned to Bechuanaland,
on the condition that neither he nor his children would claim the Bangwato
chieftaincy. But, once Khama arrived in the Bangwato chiefdom, he assumed the
vice-chairmanship of the Bangwato Tribal Council. Tribal Councils consisted of
two groups of representatives. The group of hereditary and appointed
traditional authorities and the group of representatives popularly elected in
the<i> kgotla</i>. One of the first Tribal Council’s to begin functioning was
the Bangwato Tribal Council under the leadership of Seretse Khama. Once the
Bangwato had accepted the Tribal Councils, other chiefdoms followed suit. Soon
Tribal Councils started to function even in areas located outside of the
chiefdoms.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> In 1960, the Bechuanaland Peoples Party (BPP) was
formed. The BPP leaders did not belong to any chiefdoms, royal houses or
aristocratic factions, but were ordinary Tswana. The BPP maintained relations
with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African Congress (PAC).
The BPP advocated for independence, Africanization of the civil service, land
nationalization and the removal of chiefs and lesser traditional leaders from
political affairs. Chiefs and lesser traditional leaders were considered obstacles
for attaining national independence. The BPP proselytized among former migrant
workers to South Africa, mainly in towns along the railway line, where landless
Tswana and other Africans had settled. The BPP political discourse and
international links with ANC and PAC alarmed the Legislative Council members
and colonial administrators. Formed in 1960, the Legislative Council was a body
required by the British to develop the constitution and guide the transition to
independence. To counteract the spread of the BPP’s political influence,
Seretse Khama and other members of the Legislative Council formed the
Bechuanaland Democratic Party (BDP), in 1962. The BDP later changed its name to
Botswana Democratic Party (Picard 1981: 22–23; 1987: 135–137; Parson 1985: 30).

cattle owners in Bechuanaland, and member of the board of directors of the
Lobatse abattoir and canning factory. Seretse Khama personified the party’s
emerging position of combining traditional legitimacy and rural popular support
with modern [western] education and lifestyle. The BDP had made two premises
central to its political campaign: 1) the question of racial discrimination and
2) economic growth, based on mineral exploitation and commercial ranching. The
BDP’s emphasis on racial issues in the pre-independence and the early
post-independence periods reflected the party’s ethnically diverse
constituency, and its desire to avoid becoming commercially dependent on
Botswana’s neighbors, Namibia, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Rallying
people around these two issues, the BDP devoted a great deal of energy to
holding meetings in all corners of the countryside of the Protectorate. By
1965, the BDP had successfully consolidated the support of most of the rural
areas, and the southeastern towns. The mix of party leaders, white settlers,
Tswana aristocracy and having Khama as the leading BDP figure, combined with
proselytization based on a very moderate political program, contributed to the
party’s success. It allowed the party to garner support among rural people who
maintained strong ties to their traditional authorities, as well as among white
settlers and colonial officials who agreed with the BDP’s political program
(Parsons 1995: 198, 204–205; Morton and Ramsay 1994: 55–56). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

elections were held. The BDP had previously announced its slate of 31
candidates; the BPP listed 26 candidates and the Bechuanaland Independence
Party (BIP), formed in the wake of a split in the BPP, presented 24 candidates.
After a slow recount of the votes, the BDP was declared the winner with
twenty-eight of the thirty-one parliamentary elected seats. Seretse Khama, as
the leader of the BDP, became prime minister. Once the BDP was in power, they
formed local councils and passed the Chieftainship Act creating the House of
Chiefs, which consists of eight Chiefs of Botswana’s principal ethnic groups,
four representatives from minor ethnic groups, subchiefs, and three members
selected by the House of Chiefs. The Chieftainship Act relegated the Tswana
Chiefs to an advisory role, and placed their formal political roles in local
councils. Chiefs reacted against this Act, complaining to the Queen’s
Commissioner. They asked to convene a constitutional conference that would
reconstitute Bechuanaland as a federal state, returning and guaranteeing the
Chiefs political power once more. The major opponent to the Act was the
Bangwaketse Chief Bathoen II, who later resigned his Chieftaincy in order to
participate actively in the parliament. He also became a member and leader of
the Botswana National Front (BNF). The BNF was formed in 1965 as an opposition
party to the BDP. Nevertheless, with the BDP in power, the Tswana chiefs’ fear
of losing their political power became a reality. The Chieftainship Act had
drastically curtailed their political influence, but most importantly, it had
eliminated their authority to demand tribute payments. The Tswana Chiefs dis-
satisfaction with their advisory role still creates political friction between
the government and the House of Chiefs. In 1996, for example, the newly-
crowned Batawana chief Tawana Moremi II, opposed to the government’s plan to
down list elephants on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) endangered species lists, to allow for
controlled commercial ivory trading, and the decision on killing Ngamiland
cattle as a consequence of the outbreak of bovine lung disease. He refused to
take orders from the government, declaring that he was not a civil servant but
a Tswana chief. In September 1966, the Bechuanaland Protectorate gained its
independence as the Republic of Botswana,  with Seretse Kama as the president.

.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Last year marked the fiftieth anniversary of one of
the biggest successes of the wave of struggles for independence in the
twentieth century — seventeen African countries attained their independence in
1960 to join the nine African countries that were not under formal colonial
rule at the time. The attainment of sovereignty, which was greeted with a lot
of euphoria, optimism, and great expectations because Africans were taking
charge of their own affairs, turned out to be the beginning of a more challenging
struggle, development. As more and more African countries celebrate their
Golden Jubilees and we continue to draw the balance sheet of Africa’s
independence, it is proper to verify the ideological/ theoretical and practical
implications of language planning models in Africa’s post-independence
development.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Since language planning does not have a universally
accepted definition, let us define it as a deliberate act of intervention by a
government, an individual or an interest group to introduce change(s) into a
current linguistic situation. Language planning has been most difficult for
African countries since they received their political independence for a number
of reasons. First, except for about ten essentially monolingual countries —
Botswana, Burundi, Lesotho, Somalia, Swaziland, Madagascar, Cape Verde, Rwanda,
Seychelles, and Mauritius, Africa is chronically multilingual with some African
countries having several hundreds of indigenous languages.<sup>1</sup> Second,
Africa’s multilingualism was compounded by the colonial experience. Despite the
weakness of European languages in terms of the number of speakers, they became
the languages of national administration and communication and medium of
instruction during the colonial period. Third, by the time African countries
began to attain their political independence, the dominant nineteenth century
European romantic notion of language, culture, and nationhood had promoted an
idealized monolithic model and has made the “one nation, one language, one
culture” model more desirable in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Following independence, the ultimate goal for African
countries has been to create and develop a good nation. Located within the
boundaries of the artificial states created through the “Scramble for Africa”
were, and still are, several ethnic groups. For the leaders of the new states,
bringing the various ethnic groups together to interact and cooperate was a
precondition for bringing the nation envisioned into existence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
1.3pt;margin-left:1.2pt'>Influenced by the “one nation, one language, one
culture” model, there emerged a preference for a monolithic approach for the
purposes of national integration and national identity building. This desire
culminated in the creation of national symbols including the national anthem,
national football team, national language, and national flag.<sup>2 </sup> With
regard to language, the main question has been about which language to choose
as the official/national language of the state. There have since been competing
desires between choosing either an indigenous language or an imported European
language for the much favored onelanguage model. Ideologically, those who favor
the choice of an indigenous language have proposed language planning as a
reaction to colonial practices where “planning is intimately connected with
struggles for domination, as is every attempt to prevent it, stop it, or change
its course.”<sup>3</sup> On the other hand, due to the politicking of language
planning along ethnic lines and the urgent need to implement and sustain
democratization and development initiatives to deal with serious economic and
socio-political problems the newly independent states faced, others proposed
the adoption of the European languages inherited from the colonial past.<sup>4</sup>
In Ghana, the diversity of the population is indexed mainly by language.<sup>5</sup>
Thus, language would appear to be the main marker of sub-national (or in some
cases supranational) ethnic identity. Thus for most Ghanaians, Ghanaian
identity entails a recognized ethnic identity so that, no matter the status and
role of English, the ability to speak a Ghanaian language is also a necessary
feature of the national identity. It is not a surprise that nationality by
birth in Ghana implies a language and an associated territory.<sup>6  </sup>In
addition, language is a constitutional requirement for naturalization, and it
is the only naturalization requirement that cannot be waived by any authority.<sup>7</sup>
Thus, to avoid politicking of language planning along ethnic lines that led to
such problems as the anti-Hindi agitations that ensued in India and the
resistance to Akan in Ghana, Nigeria, just as most African countries, decided
not to discontinue the imported European language — English — to adopt one of
its three major languages: Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo.<sup>.8 </sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Tanzania was the only country to successfully adopt an
indigenous language after independence. This was an exception because Kiswahili
had already spread widely, and had already been used as a language of
administration in now mainland Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika) under German
rule.<sup>9  </sup>It has been indicated that the then </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'>Governor Rechenberg of Tanganyika (1906– 1912), his
successor and other settlers spoke Kiswahili. And, since Kiswahili was a
mobilizing force in the run up to independence, it made sense to use it as a
symbol of national unity/ integration based on Julius Nyerere’s famous <i>Ujamaa</i>
philosophy. What the above observations show is that every proposed language
planning model has a function or goal based on one form of ideology or
another.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:1.2pt'> Language planning in newly independent countries
sparked an intellectual curiosity. Research on the theoretical and practical
language problems in Africa started with the publication of the volume <i>Language
Problems of Developing Nations</i> published in 1968, edited by Fishman et al.<sup>
</sup>The volume was in response to the complexity of language issues, whose
discussions are accompanied by a lot of intense feelings, such as the examples
of Ghana and India given above, as language does not relate to only individuals
but also to groups of people and societies in general. Academic study of
language planning problems revealed two things. First, it revealed the
orientations of language planning. Second, it delved into the advantages and
disadvantages of  the monolithic approach be it through maintaining the
imported European language or adopting an indigenous language, and presented
the opportunity for alternative thinking. Language issues are also sometimes
misunderstood and thus result in different orientations. Three main
orientations were identified: language as problem, language as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

focuses on language as a problem especially when language is discussed within
political and social contexts.<sup>13</sup> There are so many ways to look at
how language as a problem has been projected in the African situation. With a
focus on nationbuilding in many areas including national integration, education
and national development — including promoting social, cultural, political, and
economic growth, for policymakers whose desire is to resolve national and
international relation problems, there are too many languages to deal with. In
Ghana, for example, by the time of Ghana’s political independence, there were
ten candidates, that is, nine indigenous languages and English, and “the more
languages there are to choose from, the more complex the problems </p>

his or her own language. This orientation assumes that everyone is interested
in his/her language and, thus, ignores attitudes toward indigenous languages in
formerly colonized societies. It also assumes that there is the political will
on the part of political leaders to respect the linguistic rights of the
people. What happens to a government that refuses to respect people’s
linguistic rights or implement such a declaration?  <i> Language as resource</i>:
This orientation proceeds from viewpoints that consider language as a “valuable
asset,” that is, no matter how big or small a language community is, the
language should be considered as an asset for both the individual and
society/nation as opposed to looking at just a language’s demography to choose
it over or neglect it for another language.<sup>18</sup> Language as a resource
also rejects the use of the cost-benefit and/or demand and supply analysis that
has been used to discourage investment in indigenous and minority languages.
This orientation is concerned about whether people are using the languages they
need or just the one that is made available to them through planning
activities. The aim of this orientation is to promote bi/ multilingualism which
is the norm in formerly colonized societies, as opposed to monolingualism.  The
most challenging aspects of language planning in a multilingual context like
Africa are language choice for and use in education, communication, and
administration. The cost of developing the expressive capacity of languages and
the ability to find a role for minority languages are also challenges. What
follow are reviews of multilingual and bilingual models in light of the above
challenges.  Bi/multilingual models are attempting to deal with an area —
multilingualism — that has been ignored for a long time in favor of the
monolithic approach which promotes mostly inherited European languages as
official languages in most African countries. It is revealed that ninety
percent of Africans use only African languages; not more than ten percent of
the population speaks French in francophone Africa and only five to ten percent
speaks Portuguese in lusophone Africa.<sup>19 </sup> These models will,
hopefully, reduce linguistic disenfranchisement, that is, the situation where
language planning deprives Africans of the right to use their indigenous
languages. The goal of language planning with these models then is to use
language as a resource to mobilize Africans to solve their problems. While the
general attitude of the African peoples toward indigenous languages in relation
to their use in the formal sector </p>

was the Ife Six-Year Primary Project, which showed that with specially trained

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:

indigenous languages of the Maghreb whose speakers Europeans have lumped
together as Berber speakers. For example, in Morocco, there are three different
groups: Tarifit, Tashelhit, and Tamazight,<sup>22</sup> who make up forty
percent of the Moroccan population.<sup>23</sup> After so many years of
arabization in Morocco, the Charter for Educational Reform in 2000 recognized
the importance of these indigenous languages; the goal is to incorporate them
into Moroccan schools.   Creating bi/multilingual programs that involve imported
European languages is good. In fact, these languages have become non-indigenous
African languages because since the independence explosion, there have emerged
Africans who speak imported European languages as their first language. In <i>The
Political Sociology of the English Language,</i> Ali Mazrui makes a good case
for the Afro-Saxons — Africans who speak English as their first language. On
the other hand, the development of new Englishes as seen through such
publications as <i>New Englishes: A West African Perspective,</i> edited by
Bamgbose, Banjo and Thomas; <i>The English of West Africa, </i>edited by John
Spencer; and Janina Brutt-Griffler’s <i>World English: A Study of its
Development</i> indicates a move away from purely British or American
standards. It is also worth making a quick note of Kofi Anyidoho’s
classification of how language has been employed in literary works in Africa
and the Diaspora that seem to broach this subject. They include: (i) Africans’
acceptance of the colonizer’s language as the most practical way of
selfexpression, inasmuch as this medium of expression is inadequate; (ii) the
transformation or Africanization of the colonizer’s language as a tool for
liberation and identity; (iii) the rejection of the colonizer’s language and a
return to the indigenous language; and (iv) a reinvention of the mother tongue.<sup>24</sup>
This classification caters to the  arguments inherent in the debates involving
Chinua Achebe, Obi Wali, Ngugi wa Thiong’o and the like.<span style='font-size:

when the phone got cut off during his stay at a Johannesburg hotel, when he
came to deliver the 1990 Sixth Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture. That South Africa is
not exceptional to, and part of Africa as he narrates in his nine-part
television series “<i>The Africans</i>.” A scene in which he opens the water
tap in a West African hotel and no hot water flows as the pipe has not been
connected — and he calls reception to complain — and the phone is not working!
This is one of my vivid memories of Ali Mazrui. The other, illustrating his “<i>Africa’s
Triple Heritage</i>” was at this same Desmond Tutu lecture when prayers were
read in the Abrahamic faiths (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) and the Hindu
religion. And, Professor Mazrui opens his lecture by asking, what about prayers
from the indigenous faith! This observation was appropriate as the lecture
title was — <i>Africa’s Pro-Democracy Movement: Indigenous, Islamic, and
Christian Tendencies — </i>looking at the impact of “<i>Africa’s Triple
Heritage</i>” <i>— </i>the interplay of indigenous African culture, Islam, and
Christianity, accompanied with Western culture on Africa, and its contribution
to pro-democracy in South Africa. I asked him several days after the lecture
what answer he received and he replied, “just some vague excuse!” </p>

of exposure to Mazrui, a visual one, encapsulating his perspectives of Africa
in a television documentary series, and further reinforced my interest in him

Africans”</i> was shown very frequently on the apartheid government’s homelands
Bophuthatswana BOP TV station during the early nineties. BOP TV was also beamed
over the Black Soweto Township near Johannesburg and spilled over to the Indian
residential area of Lenasia near Soweto where I reside. To my knowledge, it was
not shown during that period by the South African Broadcasting Corporation
(SABC) television covering South Africa. How unfortunate for White South

positive picture of Africa, the pitfalls that the future Black-ruled South
Africa should avoid, and lessons learned from the African experience. That in
Mazrui, they saw a visionary and precursor of the African Renaissance. An

his belief in the spirit of the African ancestors when he visited a Sangoma

been drawn to him over the years because of the Islamic perspective of his

on Mazrui from his youthful days writing the Arab Page for the <i>Mombasa Times</i>,<i>

speaker, why he came to have such a command of the English language — both spoken
and written — and he put this down to writing for the <i>Mombasa Times</i>.
Muhammed Rajah, Mazrui’s Manchester University contemporary told me, Mazrui
wrote a piece for the university periodical in impeccable English. Professor
Mazrui pointed out to me that <i>The Mazruiana Collection </i>does not list his
1979 <i>Reith Lectures</i> under section, Radio, Television and Video
Recordings. This made me realise the importance the media plays in his life and
made sure these Reith Lectures were listed in the <i>The Mazruiana Collection

significant at both the macro (societal/ national) and micro (individual)
levels. In addition, a comprehensive language planning in the African context
should have a three-fold objective, that is, it should cater to the local,
national and the inter- or supra-national/global needs of the linguistically
diverse communities in African countries.  </p>

 Inasmuch as there is a gradual departure from monolingualism toward
bi/multilingualism, and while these bi/multilingual models are becoming more
and more comprehensive, they are only limited to the lower level of basic
education. How should the bi/multilingual models be used in the upper basic,
secondary education, and tertiary levels of education? Language planning for
educational purposes must, besides <i>formal education</i>, include<i>
traditional or informal education</i> and <i>nonformal education</i>. There is
the need to also move beyond official languages; so much emphasis on official
languages portrays multilingualism as a problem of development.   The
literature on language planning shows that it is not only governments that plan
languages<sup>25</sup>; individuals and/or groups of individuals also take such
initiatives.<sup> </sup>Apart from government organizations such as the <i>Académie
Française</i>, and the mass literacy campaign pursued by the <i>Derg</i> in
Ethiopia following the deposition of Haile Selassie, the activities of interest
groups such as the American feminist movement against sex-bias language and of
individuals such as Ben Yehuda in Palestine, Samuel Johnson in England and Ivar
Aasen in Norway were phenomenal in language planning activities in their
respective countries.<sup>26</sup> The Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL)
and its partners in Africa are constantly developing indigenous languages. This
is good news which should be encouraged. There is the need to encourage
language communities to become interested in developing their own languages
instead of concentrating on one or a handful of languages in the name of
national integration/unity. Ensuring </p>

achieving national unity and not just by designating one language as a unifying
force. There can certainly be unity in diversity. To foster national unity,
instead of assimilating them to prevent inter-ethnic frictions, language
communities should be made to feel desired and desirable in the development
process. And, if language can be linked to development then language planning
must be considered culture planning, that is, a mechanism for providing opportunities
for citizens. </p>
