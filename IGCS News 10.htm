they could find jobs, make money in business and live far more comfortably than
they would have ever done in India. Most of them had very little interest in
the welfare of the great mass of poor Africans, and we were very ready to
accept racial segregation that was an in-built feature of the colonial system.
I was very much a part of that particular background. Moreover, we Indians were
infected with ideas of cultural superiority vis-à-vis the Africans, owing to
our millennia old ideas of purity and pollution that lay at the root of the
caste system. Our African house servants were barred from using our cooking
utensils, crockery or cutlery; they could not even use the toilets in our
houses. My  introduction at a relatively young age to Britain, a country where
humiliating treatments of working class people had ceased before the Second
World War, had already opened my eyes to the sort of inequalities that I had
earlier accepted as a matter of course. My encounters with Ali led to further
insights into the relationship between Indians and Africans in a typical
colonial setting. Some of my inbuilt racial feelings came to an end once I
began to appreciate the warmth and friendship that I enjoyed in the company of
Africans. Ever since those days of the late 1950s my love and respect for
Africa has never ceased. Ali played a crucial role in my conversion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

on my mind was through his amazing intellectual sharpness and capabilities. His
humbleness and humility hid a genius that eventually erupted in his life like a
volcano. By his ready wit and intelligent line of questioning he broadened my
intellectual and cultural horizons. For me he was the epitome of a person who
would have been cherished by that great seventeenth century philosopher,
Francis Bacon. Ali followed Bacons advice to the letter: Reading maketh a
full man; writing an exact man; and conversation a ready man. We used to
discuss all manner of subjects and themes, and I was made to think more
rigorously by Alis logic and innumerable cross-cultural examples and case
studies for discussion. Some twenty five years ago my career took on a new
turn, when I left history teaching in schools for multicultural studies in
higher education. The first source of inspiration into my multicultural
education was what I had learned through my long discussions with Ali and
mutual friends through the cold nights in Manchester.  </p>

continually admired ever since he and I went our separate ways is his unbounded
moral courage. He has had more than his share of problems over the last half a
century with the authoritarian governments of his mother country, Kenya; and
there were years when it was truly dangerous for him to enter the country.  </p>

things that have needed saying about various issues, such as the lack of
democratic accountability, particularly in the days of Arap Moi, the former

scholar of wide sympathies, Ali exhorted Amin at every opportunity to become a
merciful and benevolent head of state: but the evil in Amin was so primeval and
ingrained that even Christ might have failed with him. Amin had some of the
most distinguished people in Uganda murdered and decapitated; and it was only
when Ali sensed an existential threat to him and his family that he left Uganda
for the USA. </p>

greatly honoured and showered with many awards in the USA; yet, even in that
great democratic country, Ali has had to suffer humiliations owing to his faith
of Islam that has come under a cloud of suspicion since the Islamist attacks on
New York on September 11, 2001. He has not shown any bitterness on his part.
Perhaps the most striking example of Alis moral courage can be shown by his
stern refusal to cow down to pressures from unthinking pro-Israeli extremists
on the matter of elementary justice for the Palestinians. While many other
academics, normally writers of fulsome articles on democracy, peace and justice
in international journals, have shied away from discussing the sufferings of
Palestinians, Ali has fearlessly continued to make an articulate and rational
case on behalf of the Palestinians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.35in;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Let me now talk about the amazing depth and diversity of
Ali Mazruis scholarship. We know that he has written over thirty books and at
least eight hundred articles and short pieces in both serious academic journals
and newspapers. Additionally, over his academic career spanning more than fifty
years, he must have produced hundreds of sheets of notes for his students in
Uganda, Nigeria and the USA, the three places where he has taught most. Ali
Mazrui is a true polymath. What could be the secret that may explain such a
vast production of intellectual material? We know that he can boast of a very
fine intellectual pedigree from his family. His father was a learned jurist in
the rigorous Islamic legal tradition. Despite mediocre school certificate
grades he dabbled early on in journalism in Mombasa and gained maturity and
easy facility in the use of English language, which secured for him the award
of a Kenya government scholarship to study in Britain. Even before he joined
Manchester University he had gained the prestigious Gladstone Memorial Prize,
one of the great academic awards for would-be historians, philosophers and
scholars. His sharpness and clarity of thought must have increased a
hundred-fold at Manchester University which has always attracted to it some of
the ablest academics in Britain. He was much influenced by the subtle wit and
logic of his philosophy professor, Dorothy Emmett, under whom the Philosophy
Department was flourishing in the 1950s. But there is also something else
contributing to Alis intellectual energy that I would like to bring to the
notice of the reader. I do not remember a single evening spent in his company
when he was not cutting out and referencing every bit of serious information
that he elicited from daily newspapers. He could be talking, laughing and
joking, while at the same time he could be cutting away the newspapers. He also
made detailed notes from various textbooks in a very systematic way. While many

voluminous writings of Ali, partly because of the limitations of my reading.
There are, however, a few broad observations that I would like to make in this
piece.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'><img width=34 height=258
src="IGCS%20News%2010_files/image010.gif" align=left hspace=12>  First and
foremost, Ali is essentially a political philosopher, and his scholarly books
and articles engage with a variety of theoretical perspectives in the field of
political philosophy. In his works he deals with issues concerning political
leadership, violence and warfare, resolution of conflict, ethnic and linguistic
differences, institutions of world order, human rights, the role of culture in
politics, and many other themes, in line with the works of many other political
philosophers. However, from the limited number of his papers that I have read,
I have been struck by two particular characteristics: his non-Eurocentric way
of looking at the world and the comparative approach that he adopts. The 
Eurocentric approach, that has dominated all our intellectual thinking during
the last two centuries, marginalises concepts, motivations and actions
springing from the nonEuropean world; political philosophy is conceived to be a
discipline designed in Europe by Europeans. Alis non-Eurocentric approach, built
on his profound knowledge of the history of the nonEuropean world, endows
parity of esteem to ideas and facts emanating from that world. His comparative
approach makes Alis articles also very fascinating to read; for him political
philosophy is not some dry-as-dust academic subject; it is continually
enlivened by his comparisons, contrasts and evaluations of personalities,
institutions and ideas from different parts of the world and from different
ages of history. The past and the present form a coherent whole and help to
explain each other in Alis political philosophy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:11.65pt'>Throughout his life Ali has been a
challenging and controversial political philosopher. He has been courageous
enough to articulate sometimes the most unorthodox and conventionally unwel-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>come ideas. Let me point to one such idea. In his famous BBC
Reith Lectures of 1979, <i>The African Condition</i>, he raised the theme of
nuclear nonproliferation and dared to suggest that Africa should manufacture
her own atomic weapons. He was, and is, aware of all the potential difficulties
around this issue, not least being the decision as to who exactly in the
continent could have the expertise and final authority to initiate such a
programme. Nevertheless, Ali was prepared to shock his genteel BBC audience by
asking some fundamental questions: Why should only a few nations have the right
to possess nuclear weapons? Why should other nations remain in a position of
dependency? Do the nations that possess nuclear weapons behave any more morally
or ethically than the rest? It was the implications of such questions that
eventually impelled countries such as China, India, Pakistan and North Korea to
seek their own nuclear weapons, while Israel has sought to camouflage her true
intentions. The realities of world power today have not proved Ali entirely
wrong, as can be seen by the enormous pressure brought upon non-nuclear Iran
not to venture into nuclear field.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  The area of the world that has most engaged Alis
scholarship is Africa. Just about every issue that confronts the peoples of
this continent can be found discussed in his great array of scholarly articles
and books. He does this, not in a spirit of patronising pessimism, which is the
common style of a majority of European writers and observ- </p>

but with a lively sense of hope and appreciation of the continents heritage.
In perhaps his first published article in a western newspaper, <i>The Times</i>
of London, fifty years ago, Ali sought to explain what it meant to be an
African and why Africans felt themselves to be a united people in a way that
Asians could not be; he also tentatively explored the roots of pan-Africanism
that has inspired so many of Africas leaders and intelligentsia. Since writing
that first article he has gone on to analyse a host of Africas predicaments
and promises. The nature of African leadership in the last half century has
come under his gaze, and he has evaluated the qualities of that leadership in a
fair and rational manner. I was disappointed, during the 1970s, to read of
Alis severe judgements on Presidents </p>

his strictures on those two leaders were as a result of not personal malice but
of genuine worry that ideological socialism espoused by the two leaders might
not work out for their countries: and, to a certain extent, Ali has proved
correct. I have not been the only person to have had reservations about some of
Alis judgements; the great African Nobel Prize winning author, Professor Wole
Soyinka, for example, engaged Ali in sharp debates in intellectual journals for
many years: but there was never any personal animosity between them. </p>

very balanced discussion of issues around Salman Rushdies unpopularity in the
Muslim world. On the one hand, Ali showed great sympathy and sensitivity in the
matter of Rushdies persecution and the infamous <i>fatwa </i>of Ayatollah
Khomeini that threatened Rushdies life. Remembering his own persecution in
Kenya and Uganda, Ali understood that the <i>fatwa</i> and the  intolerance of

the whole infrastructure of water-supply in urban areas. Even commercialized
laundry and dry cleaning for the elite and for foreigners in African towns is
still usually owned and managed by men, even when women do most of the washing and
ironing. The soap manufacturing industry is also male owned and male-managed,
even when the consumers are overwhelmingly women. One question which arises is
whether these water-related industries are appropriate areas of linking
tradition to modernity in Africas gender roles. </p>

in Christian parlanceor, if you will, Christiandomwhere it referred to
countless tongues when the Tower of Babel was being built. However, today, I
crave your indulgence to allow me to reflect on <i>The Power of Babel</i>,<sup>1</sup>
this time referring aptly to the seminal book co-authored by Professors Ali A.
Mazrui and Alamin M. Mazrui (the two <i>Mazruis</i>, who need one more to
create a triple heritage of their own!). Nevertheless, I will use this book to
talk more broadly about the power and ambiguity of language, how word choices
connect to society, and how language opens a window into the world of politics.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Autobiography is connected with language.  Mwalimu Ali
Mazrui (who is honorifically also called <i>Nana</i> in Ghana royal parlance)
was born and raised in East Africa, where he learned English, Swahili, and
Arabic. On Arabic, I have not encountered his uses other than some in citations
from the <i>Quran</i>. Thus, he is a Creolite, thus one who has the capacity
to mix languages and get entangled in the cultures as well as the identities of
such languages. Years later, when he became a mature scholar, he formulated his
eclectic language background into what he calls a triple heritage:
indigenous, Islamic, and Western. That triple heritage has a foundation in
language. Undoubtedly, the Creolite in Mazrui comes across in this articulation
of the triple heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Orality is critical, and it is sometimes presented as the
use of African languages or their rev ival to advance the agenda of modernity.
The endorsement of the creative power in orality becomes a sort of theatrical
performance itself. The people that he writes about are grounded in orality,
and they represent this orality in conversations and text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  English becomes the agency to mobility, modernity and
intellectual power. His being prolific is facilitated by the infrastructure of
English. His works are focused on African politics and economy, the search for
change agents, and the understanding of processes in the <i>longue durée</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  The language of a Creolite embeds the narrative of the self
in that of the nation. Although he does not pursue his work in a chronological
fashion, the genealogies are clear. There is the autobiography of childhood in
the TV series, one that talks about his family, and how that family is
connected to an identity. This is how orality structures a narrative. There is
a nostalgia for Mombasa, and the passing of its elements into oblivion, just as
the griot in Senegal will present a storyline. Stress is placed on space and
memory, which, although presented in a colonial language, are grounded in
orality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:11.3pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Orality recognizes the organic relationship between the
environment and human beings, who use the powerful animals in the jungle to
describe themselves. They developed strong understanding of everything around
them, from insects to the trees, and call on them to organize religions and
rituals. This connection with the environment can be characterized as sensing
nature itself, and in doing so, using a language that draws heavily from all
available objects and elements and working them into idioms, proverbs, and
parables. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:8.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Moving into the school system, the language of orality is
not discarded but expanded upon. English and Swahili become juxtaposed, and
indigenous languages may be added to create a Creolization. One sees in a
number of Mazruis writings this juxtaposition. It is also striking that he
brings in poetic stanzas, woven into prose. These are stylistic choices that
embroiders an argument or are used as transitional phases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Proverbs and poetry reveal Creolization, the unconscious
recourse to the multiplicity of languages and creative genres. This brings the
language of the farmer and professor closer to a mutual understanding. Mazrui
becomes a language bargainer, shopping for the appropriate genre in which to
negotiate in the market place of ideas. He is a smart bargainer, as he draws
from too many diverse sources. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Orality is about a dialogue, but Swahili is conversational.
Thus, Mazrui often writes as if he is engaged in a dialogue, with a few
sentences forming short paragraphs. These shorter paragraphs tend to invite a
dialogue, a style not drawn from the European languages but from East African
oral culture. When you call out in orality, it takes the form of a
performance. Orality does not encourage a monologue. Orality is spontaneous and
creative, and one sees the deployment of both tools in the way Mazrui answers
questions. It is not unexpected for him to be theatrical, and to use very
imaginative words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Mazruis intellectual assembly is a combination of the
plurality of issues, the plurality of subjects, the plurality of perspectives,
and the plurality of languages. But that plurality of languages gets hidden in
what I have identified as the recourse to orality, the constant references to
fragmented histories and memory. But as Mazrui deploys the English language, he
needs to fracture himself, and his presentation of the past, grounded in
orality, becomes mythical. Indeed, he often takes the Islamic as
indigenous, thus casting its impact in mythical ways as well.  This is where
Mazrui not only betrays his preference but his transparency: the Western and
the Christian become patriarchal and masculine, in opposition to the innocence
and femininity of the mythical. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;

clear. The English language is used to present Africa to Africans and to the
world, and to re-Africanize Africans in drawing from lost traditions. A blended
language, the Englishes with doses of Swahili and Arabic reveal creativity
but draws attention to curiosity as well. Creativity and curiosity raise
questions not just about intellectual innovations, but the contents of ideas. A
language has such a powerful linkage with culture that writing in English does
not mean a rejection of ones cultural immersion. Let me illustrate this point
with a citation: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:14.9pt'>Where do the pronouns come in? Languages betray the
cultures from which they spring. Pronouns are part of that story. In referring
to a third person English is gender-consciousso the pronoun <i>he</i> refers
to the male and the pronoun  <i>she </i>refers to the female. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.85pt;margin-bottom:
9.2pt;margin-left:6.95pt;text-indent:.2in'>In many African languages pronouns
are gender-neutral. The words for he or she are fused into one. To the
present day many Africans competent in the English language sometimes refer to
a third person female as he when speaking in English because of the
linguistic influence of their own mother tongues.<sup>2 </sup>And there are
cultural nuances: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.6pt;margin-bottom:
13.25pt;margin-left:21.85pt'>Most African languages do not have separate words
for nephews and nieces because your sisters children are supposed to be
equivalent of your own biological children. The same word which is used for
your child (<i>mtoto</i> in Kiswahili) is used for your niece or nephew. Very
few African languages have a word for cousin. Your uncles daughter or son is
the equivalent of your sister or brother, so cousins are counted almost as
siblings. Once again language betrays the tightness of kinship times in the
African extended family.<sup>3 </sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:6.95pt;text-indent:.5in'>Identity is central to this language use:
how Africans see themselves, how others gaze upon them, how they are
represented. Mazrui has to define himself, and language enables him to do so.
Then he has to define his continent, again falling on language to do so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:7.45pt'>  Turning now to <i>The Power of Babel</i>, specific
elements emerge in how Mazrui and his co-author present language in terms of
its acquisition and usages, its universal nature, its connections to
ethnicities, and its linkages to identity and nationalities. The way and manner
that words are used can reveal a lot about people and places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:6.95pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui presents the creative aspect of
language in many ways. It can inspire heroism, as in the career of
poet-president Léopold Sédar Senghor who was nominated many times without
success for the Nobel Prize for his command of French (written and spoken), and
his poetry and philosophy. Love for John Miltons <i>Paradise Lost </i>is said
to have influenced Apolo Obote (1925 2005), president of Uganda, to adopt
Milton as his first name. Mazrui is full of praise for Julius Nyerere, the late
president of Tanzania who translated William Shakespeares <i>Julius Caesar</i>
and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> into Swahili. He values these translations
for advancing the modernist agenda of African languages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>Politics is always central. Indeed, just as
he sees politics influencing language, he sees language as being influenced by
politics. He links the end of the Cold War and the fall of apartheid to the
possible decline in the use of French, Russian and Afrikaans. Charting the rise
and fall of European languages in Africa is like playing a chess game with
African cultures. Will the African languages be Europeanized or will the Euro-</p>

This chess game deals with choices and options, negotiations and brokerage.
The game is played in the world of globalization. Power has to be extended, as
part of imperialism. This imperialism involves the imposition of language.
Power, too, has to be resisted, in the nationalism that calls for
self-assertion. Language is part of this nationalism. No matter how the issue
of control or resistance is resolved, language becomes the critical part of
that resolution: the very possibility of co-existence within national
frontiers, and of cooperation between frontiers, involves language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.0pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>Back to Mazrui and this chess game: as we
all struggle for influence, resources, money, power and more, we will be drawn
to those very institutions and structures that society puts in place to resolve
our struggles. The states structures and its coercive approach use the
language of law and order, to legitimize its violence. In the fabric of society
itself, where these conflicts play out intensely, language mediates the
struggles between men and women, matriarchy and patriarchy. The language of
respect recognizes boundaries between the youth and the elderly, resolving
conflicts of interest in favor of older men. What we call persuasion is
grounded in idioms, metaphors and similes that appeal on the basis of culture.
The language of persuasion is of course different from that of threat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.2pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>To an extent, my point is that at the very
heart of politics and political discourse is the deployment of language. This
language, in words and texts, communicates processes and actions. Each action
has its own characteristics. The word, as Professor Ademola Dasylva of the
University of Ibadan, Nigeria, is fond of reminding me, can be transformed into
a spiritas in words of prophecy, of curses, of wishes, of incantations. If
many political scientists ignore language, Mazrui recognizes it very fully in terms
of its association with political discourse, both in the context of politics
itself and the texts used to communicate its contents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.05pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>I started with a gesture at
autobiography, and I want to close with a celebration of autobiography. Mazrui
has done various firstperson narratives in his presentations. He defends the
preservation of traditional institutions, but he is not a traditionalist. He is
a man of multiple cultures, but he celebrates identity. Amazingly, he lives in
the West, but he translates Africa. He is, on the one hand, an autonomous
scholar but, on the other, he is engaged in the              arrested
development of Africa. Mazrui is a Creole, with a style that shows how to
accept the cultures of the West while retaining an African identity. As a
Creole, he maintains a stream of dialogue with the colonizers and the
globalizers, but rejects de-personalization, rejects deculturalization and
rejects de-Islamization. In sum, that is Mzeeor in Ghana royal parlance, <i>Nana
</i>the indomitable Ali A. Mazrui, the teacher, the embodiment of refined
African-cum-Western cultural being and, above all, the Public Intellectual!
Long live Mazruiana! </p>

margin-left:.7pt'>  I met Professor Ali Mazrui during the Spring of 1989 at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. I was working in the private sector at the
time as the manager of two radio stations (WDZZ-FM and WFDF-AM) in Flint,
Michigan. Twice a week I would drive from Flint to Ann Arbor to attend
Professor Mazruis class on the Government and Politics of Africa. I had been
working first as a lawyer in New York City and then in Washington, DC before
moving to Flint in 1988 to undertake the responsibilities for managing these
two radio stations. </p>

src="IGCS%20News%2010_files/image018.gif" align=left hspace=12>  I had been
working as either a lawyer or a manager for approximately ten years when I
realized that although I was earning quite a bit of money I was quite
dissatisfied as to whether what I was doing in life fit into a larger, more
meaningful, and possibly divine plan. I felt there had to be more meaning in
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  It was at that moment in time that two events occurred that
changed the entire direction of my life. First, while employed as the general
manager of WDZZ and WFDF I was recruited by the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity in
Lansing, Michigan to create a literacy program for at-risk, adolescent youth in
Lansing. I jumped into this voluntary effort and created an after-school
program that combined access to basketball courts and volunteer literacy
teachers to help students who were at risk for dropping out of high school. I
discovered for the first time in my life that I was profoundly interested in
teaching rather than the practice of the law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  With this newly found discovery, I was motivated to return
to school to advance my studies and chart a new direction to my life. It was
then that I believe that spiritual forces way beyond my particular control
directed me to enroll in Professor Mazruis course. It was at that moment in
time that the entire direction of my life changed, profoundly for the better. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:29.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  When encountering Professor Mazrui, I found  an
extraordinarily well-informed man and a media and academic celebrity yet he was
also a man who was accessible, friendly, and generous. He lacked arrogance. He
knew how to listen and also how to inform in a gentle manner. What also struck
me in a remarkable way was his ability to hear and transform what he had heard
into new paradigms of analysis that very few persons I had ever met were likely
to consider. It seemed to me for that the third time in my life (the first two
times were my Political Philosophy professor at NYU named Gisbert Flanz and the
second was my Criminal Law professor at NYU Law School called Graham Hughes) I
was in the presence of genius. Everything that I have learned about Professor
Mazrui from that first encounter until now confirms what I was able to intuit
then: that here was an eloquent man of genius yet he was accessible, kind, and
generous. </p>

convinced that I needed to undertake a change of life direction and that after
ten years of practicing law and managing private enterprises, I would commit
myself to becoming a university professor. With his encouragement and more
importantly with his letters of recommendation, I was admitted to Oxford
University, Yale University, and Princeton University and ultimately chose Yale
where I could work with Professors David Apter and Juan Linz. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;

with Professor Mazrui for guidance. Even though he was extraordinarily busy, he
always made himself available to guide me in my academic research and to answer
my questions. Because of my exposure to him and his academic writings, I was
encouraged to pursue my present field of research, which examines the role of
Islam within the politics and societies of North Africa and the Sahel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>  Professor Mazruis writings have been essential to my
intellectual formation. I was first introduced to his thought by his book and
film series <i>The Africans</i>, which laid out his <i>Triple Heritage </i>thesis
and which stimulated my interest in Islam in Africa. Later I was deeply
affected by two of his works, his Reith Lectures that were published as the <i>African
Condition</i> and his co-written work with Al-Amin Mazrui called <i>The Power
of Babel</i>. This three works still have extraordinary relevancy decades after
their publication. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;

visiting Professor Mazrui at his new university, SUNY Binghamton, when his
Administrative Assistant at the time, Nancy Levis, suggested that I apply for
the position of being Professor Mazruis Associate Director of the Institute of
Global Cultural Studies after the unexpected demise of the founding Associate
Director, Omari Kokole. I applied for the job and in 1997 I rejoined Professor
Mazrui, eight years after I had first met him. </p>

as his Associate Director enhanced my research and teaching career. Not only
was I given an opportunity to think and learn in novel ways with one of

learned to structure a lecture; I learned the art of declamation; I learned the

which is something much more valuable than being capable as a university
professor. That is the art of being a more complete and generous human being.
Because after all, after our professional accomplishments, it is the degree to
which we are willing to be patient and helpful to all who are around us that
makes us humans who aspire to divine behavior. Although Professor Mazrui has
taught me a lot about thinking, writing, analysis, and verbal explication, it
is his example as a generous and patient human being that has been the most
valuable lesson of all. How busy he is! Nevertheless, the warmth, the caring
for others, the patience, is always there. And that is his greatest lesson of
all. Professor Mazrui makes me think of William Wordsworth who in 1798 in a
poem called <i>Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey </i></p>

margin-left:9.0pt'>  At different points in his intellectual journey as a
political scientist, Ali Mazrui has been described as reactionary, radical,
conservative, realist, liberal, idealist, extremist, and so forth.
This was partly a tribute to his eclecticism and partly a testimony to his
contribution to academic and public discourse. But there was also more to the
story. The issues Mazrui grappled with and the method he used, have sometimes
estranged him from the mainstream discipline of political science. And yet
Mazrui neither changed his intellectual agenda nor jumped on the positivist
bandwagon. I write this piece in the tradition of Mazruis own analysis, what
we call Mazruiana around here, in defense of his approach and the discipline of
political science, both at the same time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:9.0pt'>   About forty years ago, John Nellis observed about Ali
Mazrui that he was frequently and severely criticized by radical social
analysts who find his traditional scholarship irrelevant and his liberal
principles infuriating. . . Conversely, some mainstream political scientists
feel that his work, of which now there is a substantial body, is lacking in
analytical rigor, and that no amount of graceful erudition can disguise the
fact that Mazrui is more a political essayist than a political scientist.<sup>1</sup>
Mazruis traditional scholarship, that was under attack, anchored itself in
historical method, eschewed fetishism in numbers, and accepted permissiveness
of normative bias in social inquiry. The issues raised by mainstream political
scientists in the 1970s about Mazruis scholarship in this way closely mirror
the fundamental schism which exists today between positivists and
postpositivists. This is exhibit number one for our thesis that Mazrui was
ahead of his time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.35pt;
margin-left:9.0pt'>  Ali Mazrui is a political essayist; he is also a political
scientist. In the presumed conceptual distinction between a political scientist
and a political essayist mentioned above, however, there is a suggestion that
erudition and disciplined inquiry could not go together. I, for one, do not
share that view. A careful examination of Mazruis corpus of writings and the
trend in the discipline today also supports the idea that early in his career
Mazrui was in effect ahead of his time, breaking a new methodological ground of
social analysis. From the mid-1960s, Mazrui had already cultivated an
intellectual style which helped to propel him to public prominence at an early
age. The style consisted of some basic elements. Mazrui would identify a public
issue which was capable of generating debate. He would then relate that issue
to his own convictions in a dialectical manner. Mazrui enjoyed the
contradictions of any public discourse, and proceeded to highlight them. Is
this not akin to the poststructuralist method which, from the margins of
mainstream political science, is challenging positivism today? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:10.3pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>In the year 1963, when he was a graduate
student at Oxford University, Mazrui published an article in the <i>American
Political Science Review</i> about the notion of collective identity formation
in the context of the African experience.<sup>2</sup> That was decades before
the role of culture and identity in global affairs began to capture the
attention of many political scientists. There is currently a proliferation of
literature about collective identity formation, and the return of culture is
now widely recognized.<sup>3</sup> In his numerous writings, Mazrui has also
continued to grapple with the issue of intersubjectivityalthough he rarely
used that cumbersome terminologyan issue which is today one of the central
themes of an emerging paradigm of thought in political science.<sup>4</sup>
Here again, Mazrui was clearly ahead of his time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>When it was fashionable to cling to a single
overarching theory or ideology, Mazrui was openly advocating what he called
creative eclecticism. To this day, he has continued to assert his independence
in this regard, but more voices are also beginning to be heard in the
discipline in favor of various forms of eclecticism. This should be another
hallmark of a man who is ahead of his time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>In a related but slightly different arena of
intellectual endeavor, Mazruiana has also done reasonably well in predicting
some of the significant events in global affairs, perhaps more so, than many of
the rival scientific theories, including those equipped with mathematical
models and presumably greater predictive power. It must be admitted at once
that it is not in Mazruis style of discourse to attach too much value to the
predictive power of theories. Indeed, Mazrui has on one occasion argued: . . .
only a thin dividing line separates scientific prediction from fortune
telling.<sup>5</sup> Mazrui uttered those words at least 20 years before IR
scholars were humbled by their inability to predict two of the major
international events of our time, the sudden collapse of communism and the rise
of China as an aspiring global hegemon. In any case, it may be worth our while
to mention just a few of his predictions and how, retrospectively, he seems to
have been substantially vindicated.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:10.3pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>In 1975, Mazrui lamented that we are
nowhere near an international police force strong enough to keep the Russians
out of another Czechoslovakia.<sup>6</sup> In 1979, Russians invaded
Afghanistan. In 1972, Mazrui wrote: When the hold of the white minority in
Rhodesia is one day broken, we will almost certainly have a country called
Zimbabwe.<sup>7</sup> Rhodesia gained independence in 1980 and was renamed
Zimbabwe.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>In 1986, in <i>The Africans</i> (Program 5),
Mazrui asserted that South Africa will be free from the White minority rule in
the 1990s.<sup>8</sup> In 1994, the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>In 1989, Mazrui predicted: If Islam gets
nuclearized before the end of the century, two regional rivalries are likely to
have played an important part in it. One is the rivalry between India and
Pakistan; the other is the rivalry between Israel and the Arabs.<sup>10</sup>
In 1998, Pakistan exploded the nuclear device and joined the nuclear club. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>Also in 1989, Mazrui wrote: Islam in
despair could be pushed to a nuclear terrorism as a version of jihad. . . And a
future case of Islamic nuclear terrorismaimed probably against either Israel
or the United States or bothmay well be the outcome of the present
Israeli-American insensitivity to the  sense of horror of  Islamic
civilization<sup>11</sup> Mazrui made that observation more than a decade
before the issue of  terrorism and clash </p>

margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>In May 2001, Mazrui said: If Americans are
going to spend money only to listen to views which they regard as balanced,
they had better brace themselves for international shocks in the future at
least as bewildering as the Iranian and Cuban Revolution!<sup>12</sup> Three
months later, it was 9-11. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>Some of Mazruis intriguing observations had
thus been borne out by events, but given his reasons are based, to the extent
he reasons, on logic rather than empirical evidence, his observations, too,
might be dismissed as fortune-telling. We would recall that he had in the past
dismissed scientific prediction in similar terms. But, fortunately, this does
not mean that the estrangement between the mainstream discipline and Mazruis
scholarship is bound (or needs) to continue forever. I say this because a common
ground could be found, one in which Mazruis testable (and erudite) hypotheses
could be made subject to empirical analysis by political scientists. What is
more, if it is true, as it is often said, that concepts are the building blocks
of theory, Mazrui has bequeathed to us a large reservoir of concepts which are
useful for interrogating power and modernity, and for formulating a cultural
theory of South-North relations. Putting these concepts under the limelight of
greater scrutiny could constitute another important task for empirical
political scientists toward a more comprehensive examination of Mazruis
stimulating and substantial scholarship. So let the work begin. . .   </p>

his ideas about the functions of culture in my discussions with other UN

</span></span><i>Comparisons: </i>One of the most enjoyable and
thought-provoking aspects of Mazruiana is Mwalimus ability to compare
phenomena, personalities, and issues in an original manner, sometimes coming up
with new terms on the way. A sampling of such comparisons could include: Sharpeville
1960 to Libya 2011 Euro-Jews and Afro-Arabs; Shariacracy and Federalism
in Nigeria; Afrostroika and Planned Governance; McCain and Mandela and
Othello and Pushkin; Shakespeare, Shaka, Puccini and Senghor; Karl Marx and

such that the message of the comparisonswhether one agrees or disagrees with
it stays in the mind of the reader/listener. My own modest ventures into this
style include, e.g.  entitling sections of a recent work Black gold and </p>

</span></span><i>Clear Writing: </i>Another extremely enjoyable aspect of
Mazruiana for the reader is his writing styleclear and accessible to the
educated reader. You will never find Mwalimu writing a sentence  like <i>If,
for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon
the repetition of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories,
superstition, spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the

alliteration to drive home his points. In my own writing, I have endeavored to
be clear and accessible, and even to bring a chuckle or two to the reader from
time to time. Both Mwalimu and I have had backgrounds in journalism, and
perhaps that is why the writing style of Mwalimu has been easily impressed on
me. </p>

to why Mwalimu has been a successful public intellectual, to the point of being
named one of the top 100 public intellectuals in 2005 by the <i>Prospect
Magazine </i>(UK) and <i>Foreign Policy</i> (USA) as well on the list of <i>The
Muslim 500: The Worlds 500 Most Influential Muslims, 2012</i>.<sup>2</sup> In
addition, his years of teaching and lecturing around the world (sometimes to
hostile audiences and individuals) have trained him well in being an adept
presenter and interviewee. What emerges in these public appearances is an adept
communicator who is able to explain complex issues and respond nimbly to tough
questions without losing his cool.  I try to emulate Mwalimu in my own limited
way in my own teaching and efforts at public speaking for the United Nations
Alliance of Civilizations project in the past, and as an activist academic
these days in my public appearances.  </p>

<i>Humor: </i>Many academics have a serious demeanor all the time. Indeed, some
will never even crack a smile in public. Thus when my wife Kim first met
Mwalimu in Cleveland when he came to Cleveland State to give a lecture, she was
quite surprised to meet a man who, in her words, is such a jolly man. In my
long association with Mwalimu, we have shared many a joke and plays on words.
Since Mwalimus writings are sometimes quite personal, there are often
anecdotes from his past that bring chuckles to the readers.  Sometimes what
Mwalimu has to say can be harsh but he often softens the blow with the use of
humor.  In my own life, I have found that to be a valuable attribute, and I
have always tried to use humor in my speeches and while teaching where
possible. </p>

wife Pauline at my wedding. Later on, those who were seated at their table were
awed by the fact that they were sitting next to such a well-known academic but
they were even more impressed with the fact that he was so humble.  It is true
that Mwalimu has had a lot of honors, many titles, and is an academic
superstar.  However, watching him interact with his children and grandchildren
as infants, teenagers, and adults or dealing with janitors, cab-drivers and waiters
is an eye-opener to the man behind the Mwalimu. From my earliest days in
editing his manuscripts, I have been impressed with how open he has been to the
changes I have suggested.  </p>

</span></span><i>Interfaith Openness:  </i>Mwalimu is an African raised in a
Muslim family. Nevertheless, both Molly, his first wife, and Pauline, his
current wife, are Christian.  Mwalimu is an inspiration to those who believe
that religion is no bar to love. His friends include those who are from various
religions (or none at all) proving that religion is also not a bar to
friendship. Indeed, his friendship withand trust inme (a Catholic with a
Jewish background raised in Hindu majority India with a scholarly interest in
Islam) is testimony to his interfaith openness. In my past and current work in
the intercultural area, I have always emphasized the role of not only academic
knowledge about the other, but also getting to know people from other
cultures as well as travel.  Mwalimus openness to travel and getting to know
people from other cultures has been a lesson well-absorbed by me. </p>

margin-left:7.95pt'>  Professor Ali Mazrui is one scholar who has been
underlining the importance of archives and has been emphasizing the need to
find new foundations for the African memory as well as the need to protect
Africas identity. As we celebrate not only Professor Ali Mazruis 80 years of
life but also his 50 years of an outstanding publishing career, we would like
to take a look at an issue that has a lot of implications for one of his most
widely circulated concepts, the triple heritage of Africa. Our task here is to,
first, try to reflect on Mwalimu Mazruis preoccupation with the importance of
an African archival tradition and, second, focus on the importance of the
indigenous factor in his concept of the triple heritageof indigenous, Islamic
and Western civilizationsof Africa.  </p>

margin-left:7.45pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mwalimu Mazrui does not deny the existence
of an African version of an archival tradition. But, per his definition of an
archival tradition as a cultural preoccupation with keeping records, a
tradition of capturing the past through preserved documentation,<sup>1</sup>
he demonstrates that the African archival tradition is weak and that weakness
has had ghastly devastating consequences for Africa over the centuries.
Professor Mazruis consciousness of the importance of an archival tradition
transcends simply establishing national archives and/or having stockpiles of
dusty documents. He identifies five forms of documentation: material
documentation, which includes such archaeological evidence as pottery,
skeletons and coins; written documentation, which he says is what has
conditioned our view of what constitutes archival reference itself; pictorial
documentation, which includes painting and carving on rocks; sound
documentation (or what Carney Gavin dubbed phono-archeology), the newest form
of archival record; and <i>the raw memory of the human being</i> or the human
capacity to recollect in tranquility, which Professor Mazrui refers to as the
oldest form of documentation.<sup>2</sup> </p>

civilizations form the weakest part of the triple heritage. He attributes,

indigenous African science (and technology) and philosophy for a moment. </p>

form of change and innovation through endogenous and exogenous activities. She
notes that endogenous scientific and technological growth includes
advancements in medicine, mathematics, metallurgy, ceramics, textile, and food
processing and building technology.<sup>3</sup> She continues, While
interacting with their environment and transforming various raw materials,
Africans, over time, arrived at various hypotheses about nature, the natural
world, and society. The fabrication of metallic tools and implements, textile
production, traditional medicine, or food processing involved the application
of various techniques, principles, and propositions, arrived at through
observation of the environment and the experimentation at various levels. It
seems that most of these activities were based on inductive methodology.<sup>4

as the philosophy of sages. But who is a sage? According to Odera Oruka,
formerly professor of Philosophy at the University of Nairobi who has
researched on African sages, customs, and traditions in Kenya, a sage is a wise
man or woman.<sup>5</sup> In <i>Sage Philosophy,</i> Oruka explains that Sage
Kithanje, one of the sages who was involved in his research, defined a wise
person as someone who knows the world belongs to three people, God, man and
woman; and he is one who takes the past, present and future into account when
making judgment.<sup>6</sup> Oruka adds to Sage Kithanjes definition by
noting that a wise person enlightens people by what he/she says. A wise person
is also one free from internal and external hungers.<sup>7 </sup></p>

African scientific (and technological) and philosophical civilizations? One can
deduce from Emeagwalis research that indigenous scientific and technological
practice went through trial- and-error processes or experimentation at various
levels, seeking to innovate. Sage Kithanjes definition suggests that a sage
operates within three cultural tendencies which Professor Mazrui refers to
elsewhere as a triple temporality: nostalgia, presentism, and anticipation.<sup>8</sup>
That is, a sage reconciles three thingsthe idealized continuities of the
history of his community (nostalgia), the compelling pressures of the moment
(presentism), and the demands of the future (anticipation)before making a
judgment. And Orukas statement about a wise persons freedom from internal and
external hungers seems to suggest that a sage is independent and innovative,
and is able to pose questions about continuity and change.  </p>

with our deductions above, his analysis of Africas oral tradition reveals some
of African oral traditions limitations that produced adverse effects on the
dynamism, innovativeness, and development of indigenous scientific (and
technological) and philosophical practices. At the end of the day, it does come
across that Mwalimu Mazrui blames African culture itself. He determines that
two concepts are largely responsible: documentary deficit and primordial
surplus.<sup>9</sup> With regard to primordial surplus, he says that generally,
most indigenous African cultures refuse to regard the past as a bygone or the
present as transient. . . and he wonders, If the present is not transient,
why bother to record it?<sup>10</sup> In the postcolonial era, primordial
surplus takes the form of identity politics which tends to promote unwavering
allegiance to primordial identities by way of Africans commitment to ethnicity
or religious sectarianism. </p>

tradition he has been calling for emphasizes written documentation because, as
he asserts, among the great cultures of the world, African civilizations have
had less written records than average [and] for a long time, this literary
deficit resulted in the assumption that Africa was a continent without
history.<sup>11</sup> Thus, Africas documentary deficit is portrayed by an
excessive silence in African historiography and a shortage of recognized
documentation in the written (and material) fields.<sup>12</sup> The
Professors analysis of African oral tradition clearly suggests that even if
the written word had existed, Africa would still have been deprived of much of
its bounty of cumulative heresy [because] Africas oral tradition was a
tradition which tended to transmit consensus rather than dissent, what was
agreed upon rather than what was rejected by the establishment.<sup>13</sup>
For him, heresy would have served as a built-in principle of instability
through the posing of questions of continuity and change, which would in turn
promote dynamism and development in indigenous science and philosophy.

margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>Where do indigenous languages come in?
Indigenous languages were largely unwritten. As a result, indigenous languages
could not keep pace with or keep record of changes that occurred over time.
Mwalimu Mazrui clarifies that the written word forms part of the imported
sections of Africas triple heritage. And adds that modern archives are mostly
Western in conception but they are also Islamic to some extent.<sup>15</sup>
The Islamic conception of archives in Africa involved the use of the Arabic
language and the Ajami tradition, the use of modified Arabic script in writing
indigenous African languages. Fallou Ngom, associate professor of Anthropology
and director of the African language program at Boston University, notes that
Ajami has been used in Africa for more than a thousand years, and indicates
that French colonialists, for example, described Ajami as unreadable Arabic.<sup>16</sup>
While the Ajami tradition might be a thousand years old, most African societies
began to have access to the written word only in the last two centuries. And
many more remain unwritten today. </p>

margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>Though most indigenous languages have
remained unwritten, indigenous science and philosophy are still conceived in
them because indigenous scientific and philosophical practices are primarily
based on native traditions. As we  all know, the fate of indigenous languages
changed with the inception of the colonial machinery. To date, they continue to
be sidelined and are currently in a very deplorable state. Colonial powers
imposed their languages on Africans as the languages of education,
administration, and commerce despite their weakness in terms of the number of
speakers. The vast majority of the African elites who are products of colonial
schools fell in love with foreign values, practices, and languages to which
they have given prestige and priority. In the postcolonial era, colonial
languages continue to be dominant while indigenous languages continue to be
relegated in terms of status and domain of use.<sup>18</sup> Today, [m]any
Africans are more eager to learn the imperial European languages than to
protect indigenous languages.<sup>19</sup> Colonization has, thus, made
African identity something to be ashamed of. </p>

mean for indigenous science and technology, for sage philosophy and for
indigenous languages? It is safe to say that the acceptance of a
triple-heritage Africa, on the one hand, means accepting the fact that Africa
cannot deny its Western and Islamic influences; neither can Africa undo those
influences. On the other hand, it also means integrating the positive aspects
of Western and Islamic influences for, first, sustainable development and,
second, development that makes Africa competitive in an increasingly integrated
world.  </p>

serious acceptance and promotion of indigenous science, technology, philosophy,

technology, philosophy and languages but in the informal sector, unfortunately.
How many peasant farmers use TV weather forecasts to determine when to and when
not to go to the farm due to bad weather? Do most still not use age-old
hypotheses about many things including the appearance and direction of the sun
and the moon, for example, to differentiate bad weather from good weather? How
many Africans use fridges/freezers? But do they not preserve food for a long
time? In most African countries, foodstuff is mostly produced either by peasant
farmers with their age-old equipment, or it is imported. How many peasant
farmers have access to farming best practices being promoted by Ministries of
Agriculture, Departments and/or Faculties of Agriculture or agriculture
research institutes? How adaptable are those best practices to the local
contexts in the first place? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:12.05pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:.2pt;text-indent:.5in'>How about indigenous languages? Recent
happenings in Ghanas political scene offer some food for thought. The
inability of the majority of Ghanaians to adequately use the English language
has necessitated the use of Ghanaian languages for political communication
mostly by political parties. Since the year 2000, Ghanaian languages have
assumed unprecedented status at political rallies, and Ghanaian cultural
elements have also been used in political slogans, songs, and symbols to
translate candidates messages to the masses, according to Professor Kwesi
Yankah. He reveals his analysis of the linguistic situation within the Ghanaian
political scene in his lecture on the topic The Tongue, the Thumb and the
Ballot Box at the 38th J. B. Danquah Memorial Lecture series, organized by the
Ghana Academy of Arts and Science (GAAS).<sup>20</sup> He observes that the
more proficient politicians are in Ghanaian languages, the more endeared they
are to the people. He adds that slogans of political parties are not chosen at
random and translated into the various Ghanaian languages; rather they are
chosen together with local Ghanaian songs and symbols. Professor Yankahs
analysis demonstrates that political parties have also integrated Ghanaian
philosophies, beliefs, traditions, history and customs into political
communication. At the end of the day his goal is to call for the development of
indigenous languages because, as he reveals, his analysis does not only show
the importance of indigenous languages in the identity of Ghanaians, but it
also indicates that indigenous languages are resources.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:7.3pt;
margin-left:5.15pt;text-indent:.5in'>If the indigenous factor is strengthened
and made to integrate the foreignnot only Western perspectives but also those
of the East including Japan, China, and IndiaAfrica can become intellectually
independent as well as a center among other centers of knowledge production
around the world. Let us apply a macro conceptualization of translation to
further explain this. First, there is the need for translation across medium;
that is, translating oral tradition to a written tradition, in hardcopy and/or
digitally. Second, there is the need for translation across perspective. We
need to create a fusion of endogenous and exogenous perspectives; a fusion of
consensus and dissent. Third, there is the need for interlingual translation by
which we mean promoting multilingualism through translation into several
languages. This will not only resource indigenous languages but it will also
re-position them to take up a positive economic role as they can be used in
administration, education and commerce, and the formal sector in general.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:7.25pt;
margin-left:5.15pt;text-indent:.5in'>A new archival tradition should not only
document indigenous scientific, technological and philosophical civilizations
for the history books. They must be continually studied and improved upon.
According to Abiola Irele, there is the scientific spirit itself which governs
the whole functioning of the scientific and technological civilizations we
[Africans] now wish to appropriate.<sup>21</sup> He adds that What we now
recognize as the scientific spirit is the product of a whole movement of ideas
by which what we now refer to as the West sought to understand man and the
universe: the ground for modern science was a matter of historical fact
prepared by the development of Western philosophy.<sup>22</sup> The humanities
and social sciences have a role to play. Through their research, they must
create the socio-cultural context for development. The interconnections of
indigenous languages and know-how are still a very fertile ground for
intellectual activity in Africa. There is a vast and rich oral tradition in
Africa which has barely been tapped into and studied. Apart from the amount of
data that popular memory and traditional leaders still possess in African
communities, the recordings made of bards by missionaries and explorers as well
as travel literature and administrative records of the various European regimes
that were in Africa have still not been explored enough in this direction. </p>

Professor Mazruis daughter-in-law was dying of breast cancer. At the time when
she was undergoing treatment, the family members took turns going to California
to spend time visiting her. During the treatment before her death, I was there
when they said they were going to a Hospice. I never had been in a Hospice
before, and I did not know what it was. So, I was at her house when this group
of people came to set up the room for her. They were very caring, you know.
They wanted to make sure everything was okay, asking the family members if
there was anything they could do to help them. If you wanted to take a break,
they could stay with her. This act of compassion really touched me deeply! Once
I realized what hospice was after they explained it to me, they said, I bet
you must have one in your area. I said, Once I go back to Binghamton I will
go and look for it. I will see if they have one in our area. In memory of Jill,
I would be a hospice volunteer. </p>

a newspaper ad said new training for hospice volunteers. I said, Yahoo!!! I
went and did thirty hours of training to be a hospice volunteer. People think
you are helping the dying and their family, but I think Im learning from them,
because it gives you a different perspective and makes you appreciate little

the caretaker wants to go to the doctor, to the dentist, or they just want to
have time for themselves, or be with a friend. I have also gone caroling during
the Christmas season. During our training we learned how to give massages and
hand massagesvery soothing. So, I found that very comfortable and, like they
say, it was a calling for me. When they call me they ask me to help deliver
medicines if the person cant come, or they ask me to do this or that. Most
often they will say: Pauline this patient is actively dying. Can you go sit
with them, or give them a hand massage to relax them? I also belong to a
Lourdes group called Secret Watch, Nobody Dies Alone. So, if somebody is
actively dying and doesnt have a family member to stay with the them, they can
call you and ask if you can stay with them. Maybe you will be with this person
when they die, to keep him or her company in the final hour. </p>

can calm this person. And letting the caregiver who has been there sitting with
this person have twenty minutes or an hour to just take a break. You see! There
is a family to whom I became so close, if they had activities they sometimes
called me and said Pauline could you come? They treated me as their own,
because I was with their mother and grandmother. There is no one particular
experience. Another oneand this will sound strange this lady, I had gone to
see, had passed on. So, I went to her service and after that they had a
reception. One of her friends, who sat beside me, said to me, I never want to
see you again. I replied that is okay maam. Two days later she called the
volunteer coordinator and she asked to talk to me. The coordinator asked what
the matter was. The lady told her that she thought that she had said something
mean to me. The volunteer coordinator told me that the lady wanted to talk. I
replied that it was okay, she was in a grieving mood, so she wanted to
apologize. I dont take it personally. She said that she did not mean to say
what she said. I answered Hey lets not make a big deal about it. That is
human nature. But, it was very kind of her to recognize that she had offended
somebody. I did not take it as an offence, because I knew that she was grieving
a dear friend who passed on. </p>

all came from different cultural backgrounds, and the kids were now growing up
in a different cultural environment. As much as we wanted them to adjust in the
new culture, we did not want them to forget their African culture. So, we
formed this meeting. We rotate the meetings location every month. Once in a
while, we organize big gatherings, and the kids will be included.  We became
our sisters and brothers keepers. The children call all of us <i>aunties</i>,
although we are not all blood-related, but as a matter of respect. Where we
come from, we dont call our elders by their proper names, so they have a lot
of <i>aunties</i> and a lot of <i>cousins</i>. I personally grew up in a
family where my grandmother never made food just for herself. She would say:
You never know who will stop by. She would always say that a cup of tea that <i>one
</i>can drink, <i>six </i>people can share. If they are happy and love each
other, they will be satisfied. So, whatever you have to share, do not hold it
for yourself. That is the kind of community-life we wanted to instill in our
children. And, as I just said, it went well because Harith had written a paper
about the group during his first year at the University of Albany. He wrote
that most of the memories of his childhood were about seeing all these African
women, from Congo, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, etc., and the way they dressed up
for these gatherings. The professor told him that he needed to share those
memories with those women and his parents, so, it really had an impact on him. </p>

historyanywhere you turnyou can see history. I remember one of Mwalimus
students telling us that they were trying to build a subway, but wherever they
dug, they discovered historical treasures. The visit brought back some memories
from history lessons learned in elementary and high school. These memories were
very vivid to me. I also visited some religious areas that were very nice as
well.  </p>

Indians enjoy their own cultural heritage. Like the day we went to the Taj
Mahal, you see all these Indians with their familieschildren, grandparents and
parentsvisiting different sites in their own country. Tourism is mainly
Indian. When taking a vacation, they do not travel outside of their own
country. These are people who appreciate what they have, and Manmohan Singh,
within twenty-four hours of our arriving in India, was able to grant an audience
to Mwalimu. I think that was very, very nice.<sup>2</sup> The former Prime

disagree, but in a very respectful way. Reach out; try to know what is
different about people. My grandmother would always tell us when we were
growing up, when somebody comes to you and says that Mr. or Mrs. A is bad,
dont just assume that the person is bad, because you do not know what
happened, what triggered  Mr. or Mrs. A to be bad. There must be a situation
that had developed which affected the behavior of that person. So, when we
reach out to people, we should try to understand and appreciate them, and then
we can all live freely. I was born and raised a Roman Catholic and still
practice my faith. I married a Muslim. During Ramadan I fast with them, because
I have understood, I have seen that you do not always need to generalize that
Christians are good, and Muslims are bad. There is always good and bad in every
human society. What you decide to choose, you exhibit. When you take the time
to understand somebody and appreciate the differences, you can live happily and
the true understanding will be there. Most of the time, we use this <i>I love
you</i>, <i>I love you</i>, so loosely, that you dont know what people really
mean. S I love you or I care about you or I understand you with
sincerity. If you want to look at it in the Christian way, the golden rule
