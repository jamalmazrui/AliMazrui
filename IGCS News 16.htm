<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Department of Political Science at
Binghamton. From the start, he showed a knack for choosing research challenges
that were off the beaten track. As a political science doctoral candidate, he
might have chosen to write his dissertation on an aspect of American politics,
or on democratization or modernization in the developing world. Instead, he
addressed the politics of intellectual property in three very divergent
societies: Nigeria, the United States and the People’s Republic of China. It
was an unusual topic for a political scientist and was a professional risk. But
it turned out to be a measure of his breadth of vision, rather than a case of
selfmarginalization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The Ostergard paradox in research consists of human
centrality and disciplinary marginality. Ostergard subsequently turned his
attention to another topic of great human significance, but not necessarily a
subject in the mainstream of political science. Ostergard began to focus on
HIV/AIDS. But, once again, his approach to HIV/AIDS was not from the
perspective of the more obvious angles of sexuality and drug addiction. Rather,
he wanted to address HIV/AIDS as a security hazard and a militarily relevant issue
within Africa and from a global perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Ostergard went to one of the African countries
worst-affected by HIV/AIDS, Uganda. This country was also affected in diverse
ways by problems of insecurity and conflict. His papers and articles on the
security implications of HIV/AIDS began to arouse the interest of both
international organizations and book publishers. The World Health Organization,
the United</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(UNECA) and other agencies and organizations began to show increasing interest
in Ostergard’s work and to invite him to some of their health-related and
security-related workshops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>However, if Ostergard’s choices of research concerns were
humanly central but professionally marginal to political science, his teaching
interests have been both humanly central and professionally mainstream. After
September 11, his most ambitious course was on “Terrorism and War,” which
enrolled some 500 students and enlisted other professorial voices in the
course. In the political atmosphere of the year 2001-02, Ostergard’s course
became mightily controversial, both on campus and in the wider mass media. The
rightwing media explicitly targeted Ostergard and Ali Mazrui. The course on
terrorism has since been taught on a more modest scale on this campus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>On the Binghamton campus, Bob Ostergard has also tried to
resurrect traditional political theory as a political science concern — from
Machiavelli to Marx, from Camus to Cabral. He has also cotaught from time to
time the course that Ali Mazrui invented for this campus — “Cultural Forces in
World Politics” — taught from freshman level to the graduate level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>IGCS at Binghamton has had a special relationship with the
Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell University for more than a
decade. With Ali Mazrui, Bob Ostergard has also co-taught courses at Cornell on
government and politics in Africa and on the African Diaspora.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>As a man of ideas and as an innovative scholar, Ostergard’s
departure from Binghamton is bound to leave a serious void. We will continue to
monitor his special talent for turning professionally marginal subjects in
political science into central concerns of the human condition.</p>

Sebuharara, a long-serving research member of the IGCS, was awarded a PhD in
economics from Binghamton University in 2005. Dr. Sebuharara’s area of research
interest is in monetary policy and central banking, with a focus on two main
lines of inquiry. First, Sebuharara is interested in the stability of money
demand and its implications for monetary policy in the presence of significant
institutional and structural changes, particularly in emerging economies.
Following this line of research, which gained popularity after 1973 when the
partial adjustment specification was unable to explain the apparent instability
in the money demand experienced in the United States since the early-1970s
(what has been referred to as the “missing money episode”), he pursued the
attempt to improve the ability of the model to explain the past performance and
to predict money demand in the future by accounting for financial innovation
and deregulation, among other factors. Applying his model to the data gathered
from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Ghana and Kenya, Sebuharara found that the
inclusion of Banking Density, a variable that serves as proxy for the
development of a banking network, had a significant positive influence on the
demand for money, particularly in Kenya. The development of the financial
sector network in Kenya induced economic agents to hold greater amount of money
balances in forms of bank deposits, even after controlling for inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:136.3pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.75pt'>Second, and as an alternative to the so-called “money
view,” Dr. Sebuharara’s research is in line with the renewed interest in the
importance of financial aspects in macroeconomic models (the “credit view”),
which gained popularity in the 1980s, and the role of asymmetric information in
credit markets. Inspired by the theory of credit rationing, Sebuharara’s
doctoral research also examined the effects on money demand of the degree of
credit restraint. He developed a degree of credit restraint variable that he
introduced in the money demand function to play the role of opportunity cost of
holding money balances in situations where interest rates are not operative or
are unobservable, such as in the informal financial markets of several
developing countries. Using annual data from Ghana and Kenya, his preliminary
econometric results support the hypothesis that the credit restraint variable
has a strong negative influence on money demand, even after controlling for
other explanatory variables such as income, inflation rate and banking density,
which was also introduced to capture institutional changes. Sebuharara is
working on the search for new proxies for the degree of credit restraint,
constructing higher frequency data and expanding the sample of his countries in
order to be able to use newer and more robust econometric techniques and to
generalize his findings. A further extension of his research could contribute
to the understanding of the behavior of the banking sector, asset pricing and
other invest-</p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>In the modern global economy, transnational corporations
have become important sources of technology, market access and capital — all of
which states seek in propelling economic growth. States themselves provide
territory, and establish the “rules of the game” by which corporations may
operate within that territory. However, with the commodification and
commercialization of indigenous cultural and intellectual property, states are
bypassed and negotiations emerge between corporations and sub-state actors who
claim to represent population segments. Does the bypassing of the state further
weaken national or state identity among indigenous groups? Such is the case
that may be emerging in Africa with groups who claim profits derived from the
development and marketing of indigenous cultural and intellectual property.
This article explores the possibility that profit-sharing agreements between
transnational corporations and sub-state groups may contribute to the widening
of ethnic cleavages in African states by promoting inequalities between groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Africa has been at the crossroads of history for thousands
of years — in geographic terms, in evolutionary terms and in economic terms.
During the precolonial period, African peoples themselves were one of the
sources of Western development in the form of slave labor. During the colonial
period, the colonial powers ransacked African kingdoms and states for their
natural resources and cultural property. In the post-colonial period, African
states and their indigenous ethnic groups now confront the growing international
demand for their indigenous intellectual property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The transformation of international markets has led to a
reassessment of the value of Africa’s indigenous heritage from such diverse
items as art and architecture to indigenous medicinal secrets. Western society
has shifted its views of African art and innovation, from originally one of
primitivism to now one of pure beauty, grace and scientific ingenuity, bringing
with it substantial implications for the African continent and the modern
African state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:13.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The re-evaluation of Africa’s treasures, however, has been
a double-edged sword for African countries. On the one hand, it has placed the
cultural heritage of many African countries on par with Europe’s in terms of
artistic importance. On the other, that same revaluation has increased Western
museum, auction house and private collector demands for antiquities from
African countries, creating an environment that encourages pilfering and
looting not just from archaeological sites, but also from a variety of sources
of cultural property including indigenous people.</p>

<h2 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:.4pt;margin-left:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In much the same way that Western demand and reassessment
increased values for cultural property, the same type of revaluation has
increased the attention given to indigenous intellectual property from the
developing world. Knowledge of plants or animals and their medicinal use or the
possession of certain genetic characteristics can translate into significant
gains for those in the position to capitalize on the commercial markets for
them. The primary question is who should the beneficiary be? The recent case of
the San people offers a good illustration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The San of southern Africa developed a way to stave off
their hunger pains when they hunted in the desert heat by chewing on bits of
the Hoodia cactus, an appetite suppressant. In 1997, the South African
government-funded Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) isolated
the suppressant agent, P57, and patented it. Subsequently, CSIR licensed the
patent to British biotechnology firm Phytofarm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Phytofarm then sub-licensed the patent to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer for
$32 million, but maintained a direct role in the product’s development. The
rights to the anti-obesity drug have the potential to make Pfizer, Phytofarm
and CSIR substantial profits, but initially, no one spoke of providing the San
with any royalty revenues for their knowledge of the Hoodia cactus. Indeed,
Phytofarm executives claimed that the group was extinct, citing information
provided by CSIR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The San took legal action, and within two years of the
original patent announcement secured a contractual arrangement with the firms
and CSIR. The agreement provides the San with 8 percent of all milestone
payments received from Phytofarm, and 6 percent of the royalties that the South
African government receives once the appetite suppressant is commercially
available. Providing clinical trials are successful, annual sales of P57 are
expected to top US$3 billion. Phytofarm will continue to grow Hoodia plants for
purposes of P57 extraction in South Africa, with the selling rights in South
Africa reserved for the government. The San populations of South Africa,
Botswana, Namibia and Angola, numbering approximately 100,000 people, have only
received $30,000 collectively so far, but expect three more payments during the
drug testing period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>While some of the parties in the agreement have hailed it
as a major triumph for the protection of indigenous intellectual property and
the rights of indigenous populations, the issues that the agreement raises may
be more problematic than those solved. While in the short term the agreement
appears to satisfy the claims of the indigenous population, the long term
ramifications to the San people could present problems at three different
levels:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The internationalization of Africa’s indigenous
intellectual property brings with it a potential “golden parachute” out of
poverty for some indigenous groups. The underlying problem in dealing with
indigenous intellectual property is that there is often no clear lineage of
ownership to the idea or resource. In the case of the Hoodia plant, it is
conceivable that other indig-</p>

margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:0in'>enous groups may have claim over the
knowledge that the plant possesses appetite suppressant properties. As
Stephenson (2003: 49) has argued, some non-San indigenous peoples could assert
a claim over the knowledge of the Hoodia’s properties. Such claims may create a
myriad of political and ethnic alliances among non-governmental organizations,
indigenous groups, corporations and the governments that will determine how
those claims ultimately are exercised. This could pit the San against other
indigenous groups, resulting in extensive legal battles and competition for the
right to claim ownership over the intellectual property associated with the
plant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>Such rivalries, of course, may cross international borders
on two fronts. First, the Hoodia plant and other related species are not
confined to South Africa, but are found in other parts of southern Africa.
Second, potential rival indigenous groups with knowledge of these plants are
also located outside South Africa. Hence, the ownership of such knowledge may
not be exclusive to a single group, and is certainly not confined to a single
African state. Since group identity in African states is often stronger than
state identity among its people, it is conceivable that the San do not
necessarily identify with a particular African state. Instead, if the San had a
strong identity with their respective states, the states with the majority San
populations would probably be more active at protecting both the San’s and the
state’s interests. As it is, South Africa, which represents less than 5 percent
of the entire San population, negotiated the benefits agreement among the
parties, while also securing its own interest in the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>In the case of the San and South Africa, the
benefits-sharing agreement excludes direct benefits to the states of Botswana
and Namibia, both of which have substantial San populations and access to the
Hoodia plant. The South African government, through CSIR, holds exclusive
rights to the P57 compound and any derivative products that Phytofarm and
Pfizer may develop. The potential windfall is in the billions of dollars, none
of which will accrue to the governments of Botswana and Namibia. While the CSIR
has engaged in research on the Hoodia plant since the 1960s, the claim to an
exclusive right to the compound and derivative products is tenuous.</p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>Should South Africa have a monopoly on the knowledge of
P57, because it happened to file a patent on knowledge that has been around for
centuries? The question that arises is not one of whether South Africa should
benefit from the research it has done since the 1960s (it probably should);
rather, the more poignant question is whether Botswana and Namibia should be
stripped of the ability also to utilize the resources (i.e., the Hoodia plant)
within their own boundaries?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The internationalization of Africa’s indigenous
intellectual property raises fundamental questions about the benefits to be
derived from the commodification of indigenous intellectual property. The
issues surrounding the use of natural resources and biodiversity appear at one
of the most critical times for African states. In the post-Cold War period,
African states have been marginalized by states of the former Eastern bloc and
the West, reducing foreign aid and leaving African states to solve many of their
own domestic economic and political problems. While limiting external influence
in Africa is not necessarily detrimental, the contemporary situation means that
African states need to utilize their available resources if they are to emerge
from this period of significant economic and political transition on the
continent. The internationalization of Africa’s indigenous intellectual
property can be of tremendous benefit in raising capital to assist states in
this transitional stage. The potential is that the targeted resources could
either be appropriated by non-African entities or monopolized by a small number
of African states. Both scenarios result in an inequitable distribution of
resources among those who may have legitimate claims to benefits derived from
the intellectual property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Inequality issues associated with the benefits derived from
the internationalization and commercialization of indigenous intellectual
property exist not just between states, but also within them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The rapid influx of income and wealth to
groups receiving benefits from intellectual property agreements could be a
socially destabilizing force within a state. Given the level of ethnic
diversity in Sanpopulated states, the inequality between the San and other
groups may erupt into forms of ethnic resentment or violence, or what may be
termed <i>nouveau riche </i>violence. Can ethnic tensions rise over sudden
disparities in wealth between groups? Part of the answer may lie in the role
states play in the benefit agreements for indigenous intellectual property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The San entered into their agreement with the South African
government, which is the principal beneficiary of the derivative products from
P57. Botswana, Namibia and the other San-populated states are not parties to
the agreement, and are not entitled to share in the derivative benefits. This
suggests that when the San in these states receive their share of the royalties
from P57 sales, they alone will see their wealth, status and standard of living
increase, while other groups will remain comparatively stagnant. These states
will not have the capacity or resources to provide similar benefits to the rest
of their societies, potentially building resentment between San and non-San
groups, and creating development inequalities within the state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In conclusion, as shown with the San and P57, the
acquisition of cultural property from indigenous people by transnational
corporations may result in greater levels of social instability and a deepening
of ethnic cleavages that further hinder the formation of a unified state
identity among the population. In turn, the potential for further
destabilization or, at a minimum, exacerbation of the inequality problems that
have plagued African states during the post-colonial period becomes a real
threat. While the tendency has been to claim that indigenous groups are
entitled to compensation for their knowledge, such claims, exclusive of state
participation, are detrimental to building state identity and a civic culture
that will solidify the place of the state in modern African society.</p>

margin-left:72.5pt;text-indent:-.5pt;line-height:110%'><b><i>You have written a
book on the political philosophy of Professor Ali A. Mazrui. How did you come
to know about him? What elements of Mazrui’s scholarship have inspired you the
most?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>“Mwalimu” is a Swahili term for teacher or professor, and
that is how I will refer to Professor Ali A. Mazrui from here on. I was
familiar with the works of Mwalimu Mazrui long before I came to know him in
person. I first read his book, <i>Cultural Engineering and Nation Building in
East Africa</i> (Northwestern University Press, 1972) in 1987. It was instantly
appealing, but at the time, I was unable to say why it was so in specific
terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>After receiving a BA (with Distinction) in political
science, I began to read Mwalimu’s work with great interest. However, it was
not until 1995 when I began study for my doctorate in International Political
Economy at the University of Tsukuba, Japan, that I contacted him for the first
time. In 2002 I came to the Institute of Global Cultural Studies (IGCS) as a
research associate to complete work for my first book, <i>Paradigm Lost,
Paradigm Regained: The Worldview of Ali Mazrui </i>(Global Humanities Press,
2002). So, exactly 15 years after my first exposure to Mwalimu’s work, I shook
hands with him in his office. Unfortunately my stay in Binghamton was brief,
only a few weeks, since I had to return to Japan. Four years later, I am back
in IGCS again and, this time, hopefully for a relatively longer stay. What
attracted me most about Mwalimu’s works, I know now, was primarily his reasoned
and engaging discourse. Mwalimu often writes about matters and issues that
would otherwise go unheard or unnoticed. In our discipline there are issue
areas that are privileged and those that are overlooked. For instance, Mwalimu
has greatly contributed through his scholarship to the effort of keeping Africa
and African issues on the international agenda. He has continually been Africa’s
articulate voice in international politics. Many of his works address ethical
issues that are also rarely discussed in social sciences. I am attracted to
Mwalimu’s works also because I share the normative concerns expressed in many
of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Secondly, Mwalimu frequently focuses on the bigger picture
of what has taken place in the past, what is taking place at present and/or
what will be taking place in the future. Of course, such intellectual
orientation is not sometimes without its limits, such as in relation to the
smaller parts of the bigger picture that it would inevitably leave out.
Mwalimu’s focused analysis at any given moment may pertain to one issue area,
region or historical period, but his focus is almost always on the bigger picture.
“[A] most illuminating interpreter of the drift in world politics” was how
Hedley Bull, the noted scholar of international relations, described Mwalimu
about 30 years ago. The intellectual outputs of Mwalimu over the last 30 years
unequivocally validate Bull’s observation. Mwalimu’s highly readable style of
writing (to which I will return shortly), coupled with the amazing speed with
which he writes essays after essays and books after books, could of course make
the task of high-level abstraction and comparative historical analysis look
easier. As someone who has tried to do just that, often unsuccessfully, I would
say that that is not true. Among the enduring features of Mwalimu’s approach to
intellectual inquiry are his interest in macro-level generalizations mentioned
above; the comparative method, a method so effectively used by him to elucidate
dialectical relationships between events and processes which appear unrelated
at first glance; and comprehensive taxonomy, a method by which Mwalimu transforms
useful but thick, slippery or broad concepts into intelligible ones by
disassembling them and then putting them together, often with the help of
neologisms and colorful combination of words and phrases. These approaches have
sustained my interest in the works of Mwalimu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:11.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Another thing is the simplified style of writings that
Mwalimu uses, a style that may be called analytic-narrative. Great
communicators use languages that are accessible to the widest possible
audience. If one writes a treatise that only a handful of experts can
understand, it goes without saying that the ideas could not reach a large
audience and would not have an impact on a wider scale. Of course there are
exceptions, such as highly technical matters about which one cannot simplify
the medium of communication and the terms of discourse below a certain level
without distorting the message. However, in some branches of social science,
bewildering terminologies appear to be more of selfimposition than an
unavoidable result of the nature of their respective subject matter. Mwalimu’s
works are clean from such inadequacies even when he is addressing most abstract
and philosophical issues. Mwalimu brilliantly combines elegance with clarity
and erudition with accessibility in all of his writings. Someone once said that
reading Mwalimu’s works was like conversing with him. Therefore, I am attracted
to Mwalimu’s scholarship because it represents a masterpiece of effective
communication, is simple to understand and is a pleasure to read.</p>

intellectual development and approaches. Because I read widely, it is hard for
me to single out specific authors as having influenced my thought in specific
fashion. My perspective is a product of many authors and experiences. However,
I can say that more than any past or present philosopher, Mwalimu’s works have
influenced my intellectual development and orientation.</p>

learn from Japan and are there things which Japan could learn from Africa?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>I believe there are many things Africa can learn from
Japan. One of these is, in general, learning how to mobilize one’s own cultural
resources to overcome the challenges of modernization. What Africa can learn
from the cultural experience of Japan is in fact the theme of an edited book of
mine forthcoming this year titled <i>Japan — a Model and a Partner: Views and
Issues in African Development</i> (Leiden,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:11.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>As to what Japan can learn from Africa, I should like to
think there are many things. But, obviously, that wasn’t a task I set for
myself as priority and, therefore, have not thought about it more
systematically. In one of his books, Mwalimu writes that the sins of the
powerful would acquire the prestige of power. It seems to me, again, the
reverse of that observation in a slightly modified form is also true, that is
whatever good qualities the weak may possess, they are more likely to be
regarded as less than good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.25pt;
margin-left:-.05pt;text-indent:-.5pt;line-height:110%'><b><i>You have said your
latest work relates the Japanese cultural experience to African development.
Can you tell us a little more in detail about what Africa could learn in this
regard?</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The lessons from the Japanese cultural experience, in my
view, can be summarized as follows. First, some experts argue that Africa need
to undergo a radical culture change in order to overcome the challenges of
modernization. I have a different take on this. Cultural changes take a very
long period of time, perhaps many generations, and Africa cannot afford the
luxury of time. Also, the experience of Japan demonstrates that culture, any
culture, is an asset rather than a liability in the modernization process.
Given this fact, I see no reason why a cultural route to modernity is
impossible in Africa. In short, massive culture change is neither feasible nor
desirable. Japan’s culture did not change to fit the putative requirements of
modernity. Instead, it is modernity that was made to serve the dictates of
Japan’s culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Second, instead of culture change, what is needed in Africa
is to create appropriate institutions and manage them properly. Japan is
especially successful in this respect as it was able to modernize its tradition
also by domesticating ideas that were imported from abroad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Third, in its modernization effort Japan not only changed
gears from one system or model to another, from time to time, but was also able
to blend different models all at once. African modernizers in the
postindependence period, on the other hand, seemed to have viewed such behavior
as a sign of indetermination, and embraced vehemently whichever system was in
vogue. Binding commitment to an ideology continued to be the order of the day
in Africa even when it was clear that the system was not working. Of course,
the choices that were available to Japan were not as disharmonious as the ones
that postcolonial Africa confronted. And most important, the ultimate choice
the Japanese made was never arbitrary, but was often a choice filtered through
cultural prism as much as it was also conditioned by the felt need of the
society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Finally, Japan was able to modernize because of its
culture, and not in spite of it. But this does not mean there are no elements
in modern Japan that are simply not compatible with “reason and number.”
Japanese still observe some age-old Buddhist and Shinto practices that don’t
make sense from a scientific point of view. What this means is that a society
doesn’t have to cut itself off from the past completely or wipe out traditional
and unscientific practices to make use of modern science. In fact, the Japanese
government even made conscious effort to preserve some of these very practices,
enabling traditional values to remain in place, especially those that were
believed to be harmless to modernization even if they were not also positively
contributing to it. The point is that the old system should not be necessarily
obliterated in order to build a new and modern one. In fact, selectively
linking the old and the well established to the new and emerging may be the
best approach to modernization. Japan’s modernizers never sought a radical
transformation of their culture in order to modernize. They saw to it that if
there was a change, it was only to be incremental, often with some sort of link
between the old and the new. The case of Japan seems to demonstrate, therefore,
that one can be modern and traditional at the same time, however oxymoronic
such a notion may sound. In short, my reading of Japan’s experience bears out
that it pays to be flexible, rely on one’s cultural resources, link traditional
values to modern ideas and vice versa, and realize that a society can be modern
and traditional at the same time.</p>

in Africa, even in the most ‘Westernized’ parts, he was negatively impressed
that many of the things he saw were dysfunctional, from telephone to tap water
in spite of the (deceptive) presence of the hardware. This, he argued, was
because Western tastes came to Africa without the corresponding skills. In
Japan the situation I saw was just the opposite of what Mwalimu was referring
to in his TV program. You see in Japan both the hardware and the software of
modernity are all fully functional. I was very impressed.</p>

premature death of Dr. Omari H. Kokole, the first associate director of this
Institute of Global Cultural Studies, at the age of 44, in September 1996.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>Kokole was born in Jinja, Uganda, in 1952. His life and mine
began to intersect when, as a teenager, Omari began to be fascinated by my
ideas. At the time, I was head of the Department of Political Science at
Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. A remarkable friendship developed
between a secondary school student and a senior professor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>By a cruel coincidence, Kokole was admitted to Makerere as
an undergraduate in the same year I resigned and transferred to Stanford
University in California due to Field Marshall Idi Amin’s escalating tyranny.
When the news of my resignation from Makerere broke, Kokole called me in
California. He said he had dreamed about my being his professor one day, and
felt betrayed that I was leaving Makerere at a time when he was arriving as an
undergraduate student. He knew Field Marshall Idi Amin personally, and was
ethnically related to him — they were both Kakwa — and did not believe that
there was any threat to my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:1.0in'>As an undergraduate at Makerere, Kokole majored not only in
political science but also in English literature (double honors). I assume it

letters in 18th-century England and the virtual inventor of the modern English
dictionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>At some stage Kokole saw me as Africa’s Samuel Johnson and
himself as the equivalent of James Boswell, my biographer. Like Boswell, Kokole
kept detailed records of his interaction with me over the years, with the
intention of writing my definitive biography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Kokole graduated from Makerere with a First Class
bachelor’s degree and applied for a scholarship to my own alma mater, the
University of Manchester in England. Manchester is where I had obtained my
bachelor’s degree. After graduating from Manchester, Omari proceeded to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia,
Canada, for his doctoral degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Kokole’s dream about his playing Boswell to my Dr. Johnson
persisted. He convinced me to get him an assistantship at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I was a professor. He remained with me at Michigan,
until I brought him to Binghamton University in 1989. By that time he had
earned his Canadian PhD and was eligible for a faculty position at Binghamton.
On my recommendation to the University, Omari was appointed associate director
of the newly created Institute of Global Cultural Studies and assistant
professor in Africana Studies and in Political Science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The Boswell project gathered momentum. Omari envisaged two
phases. Phase I would be to invite other scholars to a conference about my
writings. Omari successfully persuaded the African Studies Association of the
United States to allocate four different panels to papers about “Ali Mazrui and
His Writings” as a celebration of my 60th year in 1993. Those panels
constituted a conference within a conference. Subsequently Kokole chased the
panelists to edit and polish their papers for publication. It took at least
another two years before the full book-length collection of essays was ready
for the publishers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The manuscript was submitted to Africa World Press in
Trenton, New Jersey, in 1996. Kokole wanted to commission two or three more
papers explicitly about my paradigm of Africa’s Triple Heritage (the triple
legacy of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.9pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Africanity, Islam and Western culture in
Africa). These new papers were also to be presented at the annual convention of
the African Studies Association (ASA). This latter convention was scheduled for
November 20, 1996. The first phase of Kokole’s Boswell project was close to
fulfillment. He had mobilized other scholars to evaluate my works. This time it
was the 10th anniversary of my television series, <i>The Africans: A Triple
Heritage.</i></p>

Omari was buried in the town where he died — Binghamton, New York. The family

in Binghamton and two older daughters in East Africa.</p>

volume entitled <i>The Global African: A Portrait of Ali A. Mazrui,</i> edited
by Omari H. Kokole and published by Africa World Press in 1998.</p>

  African cultures are less <i>dynastic</i> than most Asian cultures.
  Therefore, the power of heroic succession in Africa is weaker because there
  is less of a dynastic pull. A related problem is that African traditional
  systems of inheritance are often <i>lateral </i>rather than vertical. In
  Africa, nephews sometimes have stronger rights than sons and daughters;
  uncles may have more authority than parents. This makes political succession
  less neat. Third, African chiefs and even African presidents are more likely
  to leave behind children by several different mothers than Asian heads of
  state are likely to do. Politically influential men in Africa are, on the
  whole, more polygamous than their equivalents in Asia.</p>

one of the best in Japan for the study of international relations. Also,
big-name Western scholars such as Barry Buzan, Michael Hawes, K. J. Holsti were
visiting professors at the university at the time. The founding president of
the university was Dr. Saburo Okita, the founder of Sony Corporation and a
well-known former minister of foreign affairs of Japan. I was awarded an MA
degree in 1994. With strong recommendation from my academic supervisor to
enroll in a PhD program in another university, I joined the graduate school of
international political economy at the University of Tsukuba in 1995.</p>

was the Japanese language, which is very different in structure from the
languages I had known. I found it very challenging to master even though I
enrolled in Japanese language class only weeks after my arrival. My Japanese
language skill is still not perfect. But I am comfortably conversant now.</p>

challenge of making friends with Japanese people. That was the case in the
first couple of years. But as my proficiency in the language improved, I

preached. There are other areas, too, in which I would like to collaborate with
Mwalimu. By closely working with him I will be able to further develop the
capacity and learn the skills of combining values and principles with a
critical and informed judgment.</p>
