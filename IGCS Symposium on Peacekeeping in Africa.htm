  the symposium was to try to assemble scholars and persons who were interested
  in military policy in Africa and who were especially concerned with how
  military forces and policies can be applied to deal with conflict and civil
  war within African states. In the 1990s in particular, we have seen, in
  Africa and elsewhere, the diminution of inter-state conflicts and the
  increasing prevalence of intra-state conflicts. Our main concern was to
  address the issue of ensuring that mass murder and pogroms do not occur. We
  wanted to review how to reestablish regimes of law and order so that ordinary
  citizens are not abused or harmed by armed people.</p>

  Inherent to the issue of how to marshal forces to prevent human carnage is
  another fundamental issue: How do we deal with the question of national
  sovereignty? We had to ask ourselves whether national sovereignty should
  remain an inviolable concept as we go into the 21st century. The Organization
  of African Unity (OAU) has always perceived itself as an institution that
  deals with interstate conflicts. Its principles do not allow for the
  transgression of borders of particular states without the permission of that
  sovereign state. The questions that we sought to examine at the conference
  were: Should we simply stand by when a) the leaders of a government are

I have myself done a television series about Africa, perhaps I should keep
quiet about Skip Gates Wonders of the African World, especially since I agreed
to write a blurb for his companion book. I saw the book as a special
African-American view of Africa. But I had not seen the TV series when I wrote
the blurb for the book. In any case, Skip is a friend with whom I have profound
disagreements.</span></p>

believe Gates TV series is more divisive than his book. The first TV episode
sings the glories of ancient Nubia (understandably), but at the expense of
dis-Africanizing ancient Egypt. On the evidence of a European guide, Gates
allows ancient Egyptians to become racist whites trampling underfoot blacks
from Upper Nile. Are ancient Egyptians no longer Africans?</span></p>

second episode of the TV series supremely ignores the scholarly Swahili experts
on the Swahili people. He interviews none on camera. Instead, Gates decides to
confront either carefully chosen or randomly selected members of the Swahili
community with racial questions that were abstracted from survey-forms of North
American opinion polls. The program is obsessed with RACE in American terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.05pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>A: Some of the principal problems that couldnt be resolved
adequately are associated with the issue of national sovereignty. Humanitarian
intervention may be used by some states with superior military power to simply
intervene in the affairs of other states. Therefore, this idea of maintaining
the inviolability of sovereignty is quite attractive to those who fear the
imperialism of states who have superior military force. On the other hand, we
also realize that there are conditions wherein persons are engaging in
systematic abuse of other humans. I dont want to use the simple phrase human
rights, but we are talking about decapitation, torture, systematic rape and
murder. In these cases and in some circumstances, we are being told that
regardless of what may transpire on the ground, you have no right to intervene
because this is an internal matter. We also encountered problems determining
what could be recognized as genocide or setting standards by which intervention
may be deemed necessary. There was fundamental disagreement on how to proceed
if and when humanitarian intervention is required. Humanitarian interventions
by international institutions such as the UN and regional coalitions are also
feared, because they may be dominated by one or more militarily powerful
states. None of these questions were resolved at the symposium. Nonetheless,
there was a consensus among the participants that the kind of genocide as was
practiced in Rwanda and Burundi was unacceptable. There was also considerable
lamentation about what has transpired in Algeria, in Liberia and in Sierra
Leone.</p>

  decided collectively, while tasks are split up among participants. At the end
  of the project, a document, a single coherent book, is published. 2) The

because I felt I had to put African studies into the context in which modern
Africa had evolved. In my view, the modern world-system has been a capitalist
world economy. It came into existence somewhere in the 16th century and was
largely located in Western Europe  with its thenexisting periphery, which was
parts of Eastern Europe and parts of the Americas. The system consolidated
itself and over historical time expanded to incorporate the entire globe, so it
became a global system, not merely a world-system. I have been trying to
explain the historical evolution of this system and the principles on which it
has been operating. Thus far I have written three volumes which have more or
less taken me from the beginning of the system to approximately 1800. I am
working on the fourth volume now. That will surely not get me beyond the First
World War, and then, I will have to continue. But it</p>

margin-left:61.7pt'>A: Let me say right off that there is absolutely nothing
wrong in being quantitative. Indeed, I believe that one should be as
quantitative as possible. However, the religion of quantitative measures,
especially when they are prematurely applied to real data, is destructive of
analysis and vision. I am personally dismayed by this late conversion of the
political scientists, or the submission to the neo-imperialism of neo-classical
economics that has occurred. Actually, in sociology, we went through a super- quantitative
phase some 20 years before political science, and we have come out of it  not
that there is no more quantitative work being done in sociology  and I believe
that political science will come out of it fairly soon. Quantitative data are
useful in specifying certain things, but the mathematicians remind us that
there are many circumstances under which qualitative data are mathematically
more reliable than quantitative data.</p>

indentured labor (to which Indo-Trinidadians had been subjected) was less
painful than slavery (to which Afro-Trinidadians had been prey). Mazrui argued
that a major reason why Indo-Trinidadians are doing better economically today
than Afro-Trinidadians is because Indians have been less damaged by indentured
labor than Africans have been damaged by slavery.</p>

currently called globalization be described as a new form of hegemony? To
what extent can one now talk of an increasing incorporation of socialized
historical individuals into a world culture or civilization in the same way
that regions were incorporated into the world economy?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.05pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>A: Actually, my take on it is somewhat different. I must say
at the beginning that I do not like the word globalization, because it
implies that something new is going on which isnt new at all. What is going on
right now is a cyclical process. We are going through the phase of capitalist
traders trying to force open markets and tear down mercantilist barriers that
various states have erected. This has happened before and they succeeded for a
while, but new barriers are put up. We are living in one of those moments. So
it is not new; I reject this entirely. It is not even more extensive than it
was previously; many people have argued that statistically we were more
globalized in the period roughly from 1900 to 1914 than we are today. What it
is  and this goes back to my discussion of hegemony  is a mode of trying to
prevent a decline in hegemony. The United States seized upon the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the disarray caused by it in many parts of the world to
push a line which was previously not taken seriously about opening markets to
global finance primarily  thats what theyre really interested in. It was
temporarily and momentarily successful through U.S. and IMF pressure. But we
are already living through the reaction. You see the reaction first of all, in
the elections throughout Eastern Europe, Western Europe, the United States and
Latin America, of what might be called social democratic governments. These
social democratic governments talk a globalization line, but they were elected
precisely because of the fear of their population about the impact of
globalization measures. Thats the reaction of popular forces, but there is an
interesting reaction going on among right wing thinkers. Remember the socalled
Asian crisis? People are now saying it is all over, but two years ago
everyone thought there was an enormous crisis. There was, of course, the
collapse of currencies, a lot of bankruptcies in a certain series of Asian
countries. The IMF moved in rather draconian terms to help the states. One of
the immediate results of that was the collapse of the Suharto government in
Indonesia, but there were other political consequences in other countries. And
all of a sudden, a severe criticism of the IMF and of the U.S. Treasury, not
coming from some radical left-wingers but from people like George Schultz,
Henry Kissinger and Jeffrey Sachs. All of them said, if I may summarize their
views, that the IMF is absolutely crazy because, by enforcing its draconian
rules, it is setting up an enormous political reaction by not taking into
account the social consequences. According to them, this political reaction
will result in political radicalism in a large series of countries and will be
very dangerous for the survival of the system. After a year or so, the IMF is
pulling back under this right-wing pressure. So much for all this talk of
globalization: 10 years from now the word will have been forgotten. It is not a
very useful mechanism of describing what is going on in the current world. We
have had an assault of global finance, beginning in the early 90s, which is
already past its peak, and which got the popular term globalization.
Globalization was rhetoric! Globalization was an attempt to tell people, in
Mrs. Thatchers famous words, T.I.N.A. (There Is No Alternative). It was
saying: We are in a globalizing world; <i>ergo</i>, you have no alternative
but to break down all the barriers, because otherwise youll be left behind.
So it was preaching, and a few countries listened and got into trouble in
various ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>A: Oh yes, I should address the theory that culturally, we
are more one world than we used to be. I have been around as an adult now since
the Second World War, and I have heard that every year. It is nothing new and,
to some extent of course, it is true: we do have e-mail, CNN and the Internet,
and everybody everywhere knows more, I suppose, about what is going on in other
parts of the world than previously. Although when radio came to existence, and
the telegraph before that, and the newspapers before that, everybody thought
that those were marvelous expansions.</p>

world is into rock n roll, and everybody across the world is into jazz. But
just this summer, I personally was at a little festival in Berlin, the point of
which was to bring together jazz ensembles who were doing jazz in their own
ethnic way. Which means that it was jazz, but it incorporated Bulgarian
themes, African themes, etc. So, in the end, we have a multiplicity of musical
languages that share some common structural features that we call jazz or rock
n roll. I am not quite sure that makes us any more culturally integrated than
we were 200 years ago. In fact, if anything, there is much more variety. It
would be very wrong to see us as, somehow, a global melting pot in which
variety is disappearing. We have a very richly varied world, and it hasnt
ended.</p>

Africana Studies, including Ali A. Mazrui, consider globalization as the
phenomenon by which, at the macro level, we are becoming more homogeneous,
while at the micro level, we are becoming more heterogeneous. What do you think
of critiques of the detrimental effects of such a phenomenon on traditional
cultures  take as an example the far-right movements, as well as Islamic
revivalism?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>A: First of all, I dont think any of those things that you
mention are traditional  if by traditional you mean that it is the same as it
was 100, 200, 500 or 1,000 years ago. They are all new creations in which they
mix elements that they derive from some past with which they identify and
elements of the present in their own country, or locality, and another part of
the world. And they make a new thing to which they give a name, and they may,
for rhetorical or political purposes, say this is traditional. But
traditional is not always a new creation. But it does not last very long: it
is created and recreated all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>Let me give you an example. What is more traditional than
language? Yet every dictionary is adding words every year. All you have to do
is read a text written in 1939 in English to realize that <i>you</i> would
never write the text that way. If you then go to 1850, you couldnt even
imagine how to write a text that way, although you still understand it. If you
move back to Shakespeares time, then the text is difficult for you to
understand, though with a little effort you can. And if you move still further
back, now it really is impossible for you to understand: we call it a different
language, Middle English, not Modern English. So, language, which is the most
traditional thing, is changing every single day and in all parts of the world.
We say there is an English language, but there are, in fact, 20 or 30 English
languages, and new English languages are growing over time. As you unify
languages, you also pull them apart. That is to say, there are people who used
to speak X or Y, and now only speak English. But in fact, the Englishes spoken
in Australia, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka and the United States are
different Englishes: the words are different, the grammar is sometime
different, the pronunciation is surely different, and eventually they will move
apart again. Here is a perfect example of cultural non-continuity amidst
continuity. Because there is continuity, since you can read Shakespeare and you
can understand it  with effort  but it is also tremendously different. So it
is true of all other things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:23.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>Let us go to Africa to see the difference between today and
100, 200 or 300 years ago. If you were in an African village around 1850, there
was a local culture, and within the framework of that village, whoever had
authority made sure that everyone observed that local culture. Those who did
not were expelled from the community, or punished, or had perhaps to emigrate
to the city or elsewhere in order to express themselves differently. Today
there are still villages, but within the framework of these villages many
different cultural patterns can be practiced because people have links to
various points outside. A local village no longer has the power or ability to
impose a single pattern. There is more variety at a very local level  and that
was not true before. So I could move from the village level to a big-city
level. If you traveled through Europe in 1850, the chances are that 98 percent
of the population in any one of those cities only spoke the language of that
city  and therefore, if you wanted to communicate, you would have to
communicate in that language. In 1999, if I go to major cities in Europe, a
good 50 percent of the population speaks at least one language other than their
own  at least somewhat. And there might be many people in that city whose
primary language is not the dominant language. The linguistic variety within
Rome, Paris, London, Berlin, Vienna, is much greater today than it was a
hundred years ago. If I measure this worldwide, I am not sure there is more
variety or less. The geographical segregation of varieties are broken down and
we are all sort of mixed in. And that is probably a good thing. Indeed, we
think it such a good thing that we call it ethnic cleansing when people try
to undo it. What is ethnic cleansing, except the attempt to end this local
variety, and say that everybody in one area has to be of one particular
religion, speak a particular language, have a particular culture, and if not,
go elsewhere or be dead? And we think today that is a terrible thing. We denounce
leaders who stand for it, and other countries claim the wondrousness of their
multiplicity  multiculturalism, or whatever slogan we want to use. That is
the cultural change of the last 100 years, and I think it is very positive that
as much variety as ever is more diffused in its geographical location. <span

  postcolonial African history, which was later followed by the largest exodus

  1994 were reburied. The Kosovo crisis in April 1999 provoked the largest

3) In Rwanda, the forces committed to end the genocide in 1994 were

ethnic cleansing in 1999 were both territorially and ethnically exogenous 
they were NATO forces. 4) In Rwanda, the large-scale killing was ended by
fellow Tutsi from Uganda. In Kosovo, the large-scale ethnic cleansing may have
to be ended by external Americans and West Europeans. 5) In Rwanda, those who
were the victims of genocide (the Tutsi) were not the same as those who had to
flee the country in their hundreds of thousands (the Hutu). In Kosovo, those
who were the victims of the ethnic cleansing during the war (ethnic Albanians)
were the same as those who poured out of Kosovo as refugees (mainly ethnic
Albanians). 6) In Rwanda, the international community did very little to stop
the genocide, although there were considerable warnings beforehand. In Kosovo,
the international community  NATO, Russia, UN agencies, as well as the Clinton
Administration  have been centrally involved in the crisis, though not
primarily through the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>A solution to the problems of a dual society involves
creative constitutional engineering. I agree with those who argue that the
Westminster model of government can have a polarizing effect because of the
principle that winner takes all. In a dual society the adversarial
relationship between government and opposition can polarize the two ethnic
groups if the voters vote along ethnic lines. A formula for power-sharing is
therefore needed to reduce the tensions. One solution is to have a hegemonic
political party or an umbrella political party. This has been the Zimbabwe
solution under Robert Mugabe. Zimbabwe is ethnically a dual society consisting
of majority Shona and minority Ndebele. President Mugabes political party,
ZANU-PF, has served not as a one-party state but as a hegemonic party  the way
the Congress Party of India used to be before Jawaharlal Nehrus death in 1964.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>Another solution would involve modifying the electoral system
 with some seats elected by proportional representation and others according
to some other system, including first past the post. But proportional
representation has its hazards  including the risk of encouraging too many
political parties, or giving small parties too much power. There is also the
option of having governments of national unity as a method of guaranteeing that
political power is indeed truly shared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>A more fundamental solution to the tensions of a dual society
is to reduce the inequalities between the two groups. Matters can get rather
difficult if one ethnic group in a dual society is economically or
professionally much more successful than the other. Malaysia is, in some
respects, a dual society  with Malays consisting of nearly half the population
and ethnic Chinese nearly a third. Until the 1970s the ethnic Chinese were by
far more entrepreneurial and more economically successful.  The skill differential
led to differences in income, and grievances exploded into the communal
anti-Chinese riots of 30 years ago (1969). Since then, the Malayled government
has pursued affirmative action policies in favor of the economically
disadvantaged but more numerous Malays. For more than a quarter of a century,
Malaysia has contained the explosiveness of ethnic dualism by these affirmative
action policies  and by a division of power in which Malays</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

continue to be economically triumphant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>The troubles between the Hutu and the Tutsi may or may not
have originated in skilldifferences  but inequalities in privileges definitely
developed, with the Tutsi as the upper stratum for most of their mutual
history. In the past, when the Tutsi were on top, they never tried to even out
the playing field. And when the Hutu prevailed, they discriminated against the
Tutsi. The worst lesson in this tit-for-tat masochism was the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda.</p>

  cases of dual societies are indeed Rwanda and Burundi, each of which has
  majority Hutu and minority Tutsi. At the moment the minority Tutsi are in
  power in both Rwanda and Burundi. The scale of violence has cost hundreds of
  thousands of lives in the 1990s alone. There were earlier eruptions of
  comparable deadliness. In the case of the Hutu and the Tutsi, some have
  suggested that all Hutu should go to Burundi and all Tutsi to Rwanda  and
  make each country ethnically homogenous. Personally I do not favor such a
  solution, but such nightmares have to be considered if we do not succeed in
  containing the disruptive consequences of dualism.</p>

  the special case of East Pakistan. Kosovo may also become a single society

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:109%'>tion
  is to move from dual to plural. This would involve regional integration, like
  the old Federation of the West Indies. My own recommended solution for Rwanda
  and Burundi has been to unite them with Tanzania. The armies of Rwanda and
  Burundi would be pensioned off, and the Hutu and Tutsi would discover how
  much they really have in common with each other in the peaceful political
  process of an enlarged Tanzania. The third redemptive approach for a dual
  society is neither to break it up into two single societies nor to unite it
  with a plural society, but to find satisfactory solutions within the country.
  This has been the way for Belgium  a dual society which was long divided
  between French speakers and Flemish speakers, but which, beginning with the
  Egmont Pact of 1977, has inaugurated a system of federal reconciliation
  between Dutch-speaking Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia and Brussels.</p>

  .3pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:109%'>There may be other
  ways that can be explored to find satisfactory answers not only for the major
  ethnic groups in dual societies, but also for the minorities. Instead of
  ethnic cleansing, we need the cleansing of ethnicity  an effort to make
  ethnic differences culturally healthy rather than politically divisive.</p>

give the worst possible interpretation of what was being said by interviewees
in a place like Lamu. Who is the best authority on Muslim atrocities in
Zanzibar? Well, in Gates opinion, a Christian missionary priest in Zanzibar!
Gates does not find it necessary to balance the testimony of such a biased
witness with anyone else. Any journalist worth his salt would have done better!</span></p>

thought that in episode 3, which concerned the trans-Atlantic slave trade,
Gates would at last regard the West and the white man as relevant actors in the
African tragedy. Before seeing the episode I said to a colleague in Ohio that
surely Gates could not deal with the trans-Atlantic slave trade without
regarding the West and the white man as crucial! Was I wrong? Gates manages to
make an African say that without the participation of Africans, there would
have been no slave trade! How naive about power can we get?</span></p>

Without the involvement of Africans, there would have been no apartheid.

European Jewish capitalists at all as collaborators in the slave-trade?</span></p>

relieved that it was merely disrespectful. I wished he was more politely
dressed when he was granted an audience to a major religious leader. I wished
he kept his sarcasm about the authenticity of the Covenant in check. I wished
he did not make as many snide remarks which trivialized other peoples values.
And I wished that viewers were not kept informed on camera as to how many car
breakdowns he had had. Surely he had better footage of African scenes!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>Binghamton University singled out the last semester of the
millennium for a celebration of the Greeks across time and space. This
institute was privileged to participate in this salute to Greece, including the
publication of a number of texts of Greek philosophy, such as a new translation
and commentary of Aristotles Nicomachean Ethics. The director of this
institute also marked the 32nd anniversary since he gave his Professorial
Inaugural Lecture at Makerere University in Uganda. His inaugural lecture was
on Ancient Greece in African Political Thought. That was, of course, long
before he became director of global cultural studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>The Greeks are arguably the parents of rationalism, and by a
strange destiny, they are also the parents of athleticism. They led the way in
both mental and physical gymnastics! Through their philosophers, the Greeks
climbed the Parnassus of intellectual achievement. Through their Olympic Games,
the Greeks ran the mile of physical endurance. According to tradition, the
Olympic Games were first celebrated in the year 776 BCE at Olympia, about 2,500
years before the American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The Olympics
were repeated at intervals of four years until the Romans abolished them in 393
CE. The Olympics were revived in 1896 in a new stadium in Athens. Once again
the Greeks were leading the world in the culture of the body - just as they
once led the world in the culture of the mind. Their culture of the mind is
also what our annual October conference has celebrated every year at Binghamton
as the specialists have explored the philosophical riches of Aristotlean,
Platonic and Neo-Platonic traditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:123.1pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:.5pt'>The Greeks also gave us such concepts as the
philosopher king. On Oct. 23, 1999, in a village in faraway Tanzania, a
philosopher king was buried. His name was Julius K. Nyerere. Nyerere was a
ruler who was also a thinker. He was accorded the title of mwalimu, meaning
teacher or mentor. He was often in a class by himself as a national leader
on the world scene - combining high ethics with high intellect. He was a
philosopher-ruler in the best sense of the concept. Tanzania does not have
Parnassus, the Mountain of the Muses. But it does have Kilimanjaro, Africas
highest mountain - a physical pinnacle worthy of its intellectual son, Julius
Nyerere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:123.2pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:.5pt'>Our October philosophical conferences have increasingly
become a meeting of the minds, encounters of cultures, occasionally collisions
of paradigms. We have annually provided an arena where Classicists meet
Medievalists; Medievalists confront Modernists - across European, Islamic,
African, Asian and other frontiers of knowledge.</p>

least upsetting. Gates did try to capture the glories of pre-colonial southern
Africa and did pose some of the challenges of the post-colonial and
post-apartheid eras. But even this sixth program was more of a tourist
travelogue than a serious portrayal of a people. It is hard to believe that
such a TV series was the product of such a brilliant mind!</p>

series again, perhaps I should give it a second chance! But I fear that we have
been let down badly!</p>
