from Abdul Bemath of South Africa and Seifudein Adem, my Ethiopian colleague at
our Institute of Global Cultural Studies at Binghamton.  Abdul and Seifudein
offered to edit some of my unpublished papers and lectures on the specific
issues of violence and war.  I helped them in the selection of the papers.  The

and put forward a specific thesis to be argued in the book.  The volume starts
from the premise that Arabs and Jews began as one Abrahamic family of Semites. 
And then over the centuries they geographically diverged.  The Jews moved more
and more into the European shores of the Mediterranean, such as Spain, and
gradually dispersed into much of the rest of Europe.  The Arabs populated the
African shores of the Mediterranean, and expanded southwards, spreading Islam
and Arab culture into much of sub-Saharan Africa.  Over many generations, Jews
became more and more Europeanized – and were eventually transformed into the
most influential minority group in the history of the Western world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

more Muslims but created more native speakers of the Arabic language, and whole
new Arab societies.  Indeed, by the twentieth century, there were more Arabs on
the African continent than in the rest of the Arab world added together.  With
the editorial help of Seifudein Adem, a new Mazruiana book was published titled
<i>Euro-Jews and AfroArabs: The Great Semitic Divergence in World History, </i>published
by University Press of America, Inc., in Lanham, Maryland, in time for my 75<sup>th</sup>

take them to the United States to avail themselves of those scholarships.  With
the help of Senator John F. Kennedy (running to become U.S. President) and

British Parliament legislated against the slave trade in 1807, the United
States Congress did not follow suit until the following year.  From an American
point of view, the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade was
therefore not 2007 but 2008. </p>

co-sponsored and co-hosted with Howard University the first major celebration
of the Congressional Act abolishing the slave trade in 1808.  Professor Joseph
Harris of Howard was a truly dedicated coordinator of the event at the National
Archives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            In my own presentation at the Archives in January
2008 I once again posed the question whether the Abolitionist Movement in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was in fact an earlier war on terror. 
Although the word “terrorism” did not yet exist two centuries ago, the actual
experience of “terror” was omnipresent in the different stages from the
slave-raid in Africa to enslaved life on the plantation somewhere in the
Americas.  There was the terror of being captured, of being marched for a while
overland to Africa’s Atlantic shores, the terror of waiting in dungeons in the
slave fort of Ghana or Senegal, then the terror of the middle-passage in the
form of slave-laden ships across the Atlantic, the terror of being marketed,
and the prolonged slave labour on a plantation in perpetuity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            If the entire slave-system was a regiment of
terror writ-large, the abolitionist movement was indeed a kind of war <u>against</u>
terror, seeking to end such a prolonged victimization of the innocent.  Primary
abolitionists were Africans themselves within Africa, trying to abort the evil
transactions which carried away so many African captives across the seas. 
These primary African abolitionists included Affonso of Congo who tried to
sabotage the slave trade in the eighteenth century.  There was also Queen
Nzinga Nbande of Matamba in 17<sup>th</sup> century Angola who tried to
mobilize popular African resistance to the trade. King Agaja Trudo of Dahomey
was another militant primary abolitionist. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>Slave rebellions were not necessarily
abolitionist if the primary purpose was just to free the particular captives
rather than to end the system as a whole.  A slave <u>revolution</u>, on the
other hand, can be abolitionist if the aim is to free all slaves and terminate
the trade.  In that regard, the Haitian revolution of 1804 may therefore be
regarded as abolitionist in intention and not merely a rebellion.  While Queen
Nzinga Nbande and Affonso of Congo were primary abolitionists of the African
continent, Toussaint L’Overture of Haiti was a primary abolitionist of the
African Diaspora.  Also a primary abolitionist of the Diaspora was Frederick
Douglass of the United States later in the nineteenth century.           Secondary
abolitionists are drawn from the master race.  John Brown of the United States
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>William Wilberforce in Britain were, in that sense, dedicated
secondary abolitionists.  In the case of Wilberforce, he illustrated how a
secondary abolitionist from the master race can have a greater impact than
multiple primary abolitionists struggling to resist in Africa. </p>

Scotland, in February 2008.  In reality the Aberdeen event was a belated salute
to the British ban on the slave trade in 1807 rather than a celebration of the
American ban the following year.  But in the discussions nobody cared much
about which of the two legislatures (Westminster or Capitol Hill) outlawed the
slave-trade earlier.  The Scottish City of Aberdeen supported the celebration
at the highest municipal level.  The Scottish equivalent of the Lord Mayor and
other dignitaries not only attended the symposium but also graced the elegant

power.  An even more explosive paradox of mine was that Nkrumah was a great
African, but not a great Ghanaian.  In 2007, as during my earlier visits to

amount of international attention it had received after its elections from the
African Union, the European Union, the United States, other African Leaders and
the indefatigable Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  If the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo had received half the attention Kenya had got after the
election, two million Congolese lives might have been saved.  If the Congo has
been the most internationally neglected African crisis of this 21<sup>st</sup>
century, the Kenya crisis following the last week of December 2007 had been the
most responded to internationally. </p>

Kenya had been one of the beacons of hope in sub-Saharan Africa.  In 2002 a
political party, which had been in power since independence in 1963, was
successfully thrown out of office by the electorate.  Mwai Kibaki peacefully
became the new President of Kenya, in alliance with Raila Odinga as a Minister.

margin-left:-.25pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:

Kibaki regime created a more open society.  The Press became much freer, both
printed and electronic, in spite of periodic harassment by the police. 
Preventive detention of political opponents became more and more rare, though
Muslims were targeted more often.  The government encouraged an annual
accountability of performance in human rights, including the equivalent of
National Ombudsman in Kenya.  The Kibaki regime attempted to deal with judicial
corruption by sacking certain judges.  President Kibaki vetoed parliamentary
legislation, which would have forced reporters and journalists to disclose
their sources for stories about corruption.  This particular veto by President
Kibaki put Kenya ahead of the United States in the protection of the sources of
journalists and reporters.  In the United States in 2005 a high profile <u>New
York Times</u> reporter, Judith Miller, went to prison for refusing to disclose
her sources.  All the evidence before the December elections indicated that the
legacy of Mwai Kibaki as President would be a celebration of a more open
society in Kenya. </p>

of the elections would have vindicated a Kibaki legacy of “the open society.” 
One powerful Kenyan after another was voted out of his or her parliamentary
seat.  Half of the members of Kibaki’s Cabinet were angrily thrown out of power
by the electorate, including the Vice-President.  The stage was set for a
probable electoral defeat of the Kibaki regime. </p>

defeat of an incumbent president and his gracious acceptance of the verdict of
the electorate.  The defeat of an incumbent president had previously happened
in Zambia, Malawi, Senegal, Mauritius and elsewhere.  A version of it had also
happened in Ghana when Jerry Rawling’s party was electorally defeated. </p>

circumstances which cast doubt on the fairness of the outcome.  Almost none of
the external observers were prepared to confirm President Mwai Kibaki as a
fairly and democratically elected president.  There were no open
congratulations from even the White House and No. 10 Downing Street.  There was
a serious risk that the Kibaki legacy would change from the architect of “the
Open Society in Kenya” to the architect of “the Broken State”. </p>

of Kenya becoming another failed state in a region which already had too many
failed states (Somalia, Rwanda, CongoKinshasa, Burundi, and the semi-flawed
States of Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan).  In the past Kenya was the asylum state
for the refugees from Uganda, Somalia, Ethiopia and elsewhere.  The Kenya
elections of December 2007 had reversed the flow of refugees.  There were now
thousands of Kenya refugees in Uganda, instead of the other way around. </p>

the most damaging episode to national unity since the assassination of Tom
Mboya in July 1969. Both the murder of Tom Mboya and the management of the

ethnically monopolise the presidency of the country.  Both Mboya’s
assassination and the 2007 elections were seen as historic blows to national
stability and major setbacks to the process of democratization. Both Mboya’s
murder and the 2007 elections unleashed widespread rioting and looting and made

emotions and tensions in Kenya which before long might require a whole new
vocabulary.  I raised the question whether we were on the verge of producing a
form of inter-ethnic distrust which might be called <i>KIKUYUPHOBIA</i>? Had
other Kenyans begun to identify a form of prejudice which may be called <i>LUOPHOBIA? 
Let me re-state the issues.  </i>A Kikuyuphobe is a person who is profoundly
distrustful of the Kikuyu –– a form of negativism which is partly based on a
stereotype. The Kikuyu are seen as manipulative, exploitative and inclined
towards ethnic nepotism and tribal favoritism. The Kikuyu are seen as brilliant
in commercial aptitude and other economic skills, but often at the expense of
other groups. Kenyans should be careful not to reduce whole communities into
such negative stereotypes. Such prejudice tends to dehumanize the targeted
groups.  </p>

margin-left:-.25pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:
normal'> <i>Luophobia</i> is a form of distrust and prejudice against the rival
ethnic group, the Luo. While supporters of Raila Odinga are often prone to
Kikuyuphobia, ardent supporters of Mwai Kibaki often manifest forms of
Luophobia.  I have argued that in both directions Kenyans should distrust their
stereotypes, seek to contain their particular versions of “pride and
prejudice”, and seek to cultivate instead some kind of “sense and sensibility”.
The English novelist, Jane Austen, is assuming a new form of political relevance
in the unfolding drama of Kenya after the December elections of 2007. </p>

is likely to be the impact of both Kikuyuphobia and Luophobia on higher
education in Kenya? While the Kikuyu as a group have been politically and
commercially triumphant almost nation wide, the Luo have been
disproportionately triumphant in the academic domain and among public
intellectuals. While in creative literature the Kikuyu have led the way with
Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Micere Mugo and others, the Luo of Kenya have led the way in
the study of history, in the social and natural sciences and in the study of
African philosophy. Some have argued that while the Kikuyu are brilliant
economic entrepreneurs, the Luo of Kenya have had an edge in academic and
intellectual performance. Nevertheless, Kenya’s first Nobel Prize Laureate for
Peace has been a Kikuyu – Wangari Maathai. </p>

crisis on higher education in Kenya? Even before the December election there
was already an ethnic presence in classrooms on Kenyan campus. While
professional promotions in Kenyan universities were already affected by

ethnic-neutral on the whole. But the threat of ethicizing exam grades has
become real since the beginning of 2008. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>From ancient sacred waters to modern secular oil.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            The history of Islam has in part been a dialectic
between water as an ancestral natural resource and petroleum as a modern
industrial commodity.  The birthplace of Islam, the Hijaz, was ancestrally
short of water.  In modern history Arabia has become a location of abundance of
oil.  In both Africa and the Middle East nature has been kind to Muslim areas
with one liquid (oil) but less kind to the Muslim parts of Africa and the
Middle East often short of another liquid (water). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            Islam’s love affair with water as something
sacred began with <u>Zamzam</u>, the sacred well of Mecca which is sometimes
described as the well of Ismail.  The Zamzam is located within the sacred
complex of the Kaaba, opposite the sanctuary of the Black Stone.  Pilgrims to
Mecca seek to drink from Zamzam, and take its water home to administer to the
sick.  Zamzam was an ecological lesson to Muslims throughout history, teaching
them to regard water and its purity as sacred.        On the other hand, the
actual worship of rivers in the Middle East declined with the consolidation of Islam. 
No river under Muslim jurisdiction has ever enjoyed the level of divinity which
is attributed to the Ganges by the Hindus in India.  Over the centuries the
Nile became the most important, as well as longest, river under Muslim
jurisdiction as it meandered down the valleys of Uganda, Ethiopia, the Sudan
and Egypt.  As the longest waterway in the world, the Nile had given birth to
ancient Egyptian civilization, and continued to be crucial to the survival of
both Byzantine Christian Egypt and to Muslim Egypt afterwards.  But while under
the Pharaohs the Nile enjoyed divine status almost the equivalent of the Ganges
to the Hindus in India, under Islamic values the Nile remained metaphorically
sacred but no longer literally divine.  But I personally will always remember
the source of the Nile as the genesis of my academic career – the source being
from Lake Victoria in Uganda. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

Kansas, genetically related to George Bush’s Vice-President Dick Cheney
(according to U.S. Press reports).  There has been speculation about whether
both Obama’s Kenyan father and his Euro-American mother were intellectually
brilliant.  Would that explain Barack’s outstanding performance at Harvard Law
School where he became the first African American President of the Harvard Law
Journal, and graduated from Harvard at the top of his class (magna cum laude). 
Barack Obama’s intellectual brilliance may also have been crucial in his
remarkable performance as a strategist and campaigner for the Democratic
Party’s 2008 nomination for the U.S. presidency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            It is quite clear that having had a white
American mother has not hurt Barack Obama in the primary campaign for President
of the United States.  On the contrary, it is widely believed that his white
mother (deceased) and his white grandmother (still alive and very supportive)
have been major assets electorally to most white voters. </p>

margin-left:.5pt'>            But what if Barack Obama had had a white <u>wife</u>
instead of a white mother?  Is American white opinion more comfortable with a
Black man whose mother was white than with a Black man married to a white
woman?  Indeed, would African American voters have been more alienated from
Barack Obama if his prospective First Lady for the White House had been a
European American? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            Both white and black opinion in America is of
course aware that nobody is ever in a position to choose their own biological
parents!  Barack had no say in the marriage between the white female student
from Kansas studying at the University of Hawaii and the Luo student from Kenya
studying at the same university.  They were destined to be his parents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>            However, Barack’s own choice of spouse was within
his own volition.  If Barack had indeed decided to propose to a white woman and
married her, it is almost certain that his candidacy as a prospective President

“wedded miscegenation” than it has been by his parents’ intermarriage. </p>

Prime Minister not in our mother country, Kenya, but in Barack Obama’s country
of birth, the United States.  In his speech at a luncheon in his honour in
Washington D.C., Odinga drew the attention of the large audience to my presence
in their midst.  I stood up to a thunderous applause.  He then referred to my
historic question as to which country would be the first to elect a Luo
President: Kenya or the United States.  Prime Minister Odinga gave his own witty
reply with a broad smile.  “The question has actually been answered in Kenya’s
favour.  Kenya has a Luo President who has not been sworn in.”  The huge
