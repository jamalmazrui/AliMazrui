African descent in the global movement for decolonization in the middle decades
of the twentieth century as well as one of the most noted panAfricanists of all
time.  Ali Mazrui was one of the most famous intellectuals of African descent
of the twentieth century.  Nkrumah lost state power in Ghana in 1966, at the
very moment that Mazrui began to emerge as a scholar.  The two were joined
discursively in a (in)famous article that Mazrui wrote on Nkrumah’s fall. 
Entitled “Nkrumah: The Leninist Czar,” this article became the source of major
controversy in Black intellectual and political circles worldwide.  The article
also provided the foundation for a decades-long engagement of Nkrumah’s ideas
by Mazrui, during the course of which the latter came to a much greater
intellectual appreciation of the former.  More broadly, the controversy set in
train by Mazrui’s article was one of the outstanding pan-African debates of the
postcolonial era. </span></p>

consequential figure of African descent in the global movement for
decolonization, which swept colonialism from the greater part of Asia and
Africa after World War II.  Nkrumah began his career as an anticolonial agitator
in the British colony of the Gold Coast in 1947.  Exactly a decade later, in
1957, the colony attained sovereign nationhood under the leadership of his
Convention People’s Party, the most storied anticolonial movement in Africa. 
Ghana, the name the former Gold Coast assumed at independence, was the first
territory in Africa south of the Sahara to escape the colonial yoke.  Ghana,
and Nkrumah personally, became de rigueur, celebrated in music, poetry, sermons
and other forms of literary and artistic expressions in Africa and the
far-flung African diaspora.  A Black Star, a sobriquet accorded Nkrumah, had
been born.  But then as stars -- political and otherwise – often do, Nkrumah
precipitously fell.  In 1966 he suddenly lost power, overthrown in a military takeover. 
His ouster spawned an expansive body of work on “the rise and fall of Kwame
Nkrumah,” as several contributors to this literary genre entitled their
accounts of his two-decades-long whirlwind of a political career.<sup>1</sup> </p>

and most contentious, installments on the narrative on Nkrumah’s fall from
power.  But this was just prelude.  Mazrui’s engagement with Nkrumah would have
many a sequel, stretching over nearly five decades, which is to say for the
rest of Mazrui’s life.  From a highly critical beginning, Mazrui warmed up to
Nkrumah over time, his appraisal of Ghana’s first postcolonial leader becoming
increasingly more favorable as the years went by.  Along the way, Nkrumah’s writings
came to provide some of the essential building blocks for the trope that is
Mazrui’s greatest intellectual legacy, for general audiences if not for the
cognoscenti—namely, the idea that Africa is a continent with “a triple
heritage”: African, Islamic and Western.  Initially offered as a television
documentary on BBC in Britain and PBS in the United States, the triple-heritage
idea did double duty, later reappearing in book form.<sup>2</sup> </p>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>“Nkrumah: The Leninist Czar.”<sup>3</sup> 
Such was the bold and brash title of the essay Mazrui published in the wake of
Nkrumah’s fall.  In a lifetime as an intellectual gadfly, this was Mazrui’s
most provocative piece to date.  The fiery reaction, mostly negative, was also
the first of the many notable debates in which he would become embroiled.  The
site of the debate also mattered.  Mazrui’s essay, along with most (although
not all) of the responses it engendered, appeared in <i>Transition</i>.  Based
in Kampala, Uganda, <i>Transition</i> was a magazine of the arts, culture, and
politics.  Necessarily, the faculty at nearby Makerere University College
(later Makerere University), where Mazrui taught, played an outsize role in
magazine.  Mazrui himself was an associate editor of <i>Transition</i>, which
gave his essay unprecedented promotion.  The lead article in the issue in which
it appeared, the essay was preceded by a lavish and colorful illustration that
took up the entire cover of the magazine.  (Generally, the cover of <i>Transition</i>
was in black and white, not color.)  The illustration featured an image of
Nkrumah’s head at one end and that of the Russian revolutionary leader V. I.
Lenin at the other, separated by a single shirt with identical collars.  The
name of the magazine, <i>Transition</i>, appeared at both ends of the
illustration, except it was transposed at the bottom.  When turned upside down,
Lenin was on top and Nkrumah at the bottom, which neatly illustrated the point
of the essay: that Nkrumah, very consciously so, was an African version of
Lenin.  Mazrui also received top billing in the section of the journal that
listed the contributors: he was the sole author in that issue whose
biographical summary was accompanied by a mug shot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Clearly, a decision had been made to
showcase the essay by <i>Transition</i>’s associate editor, and to spare no
expense in doing so.  It assuredly was an investment on which a return was
expected—intellectual, political, and commercial.  Accordingly, the editors
dispatched a copy of the issue with Mazrui’s essay to Nkrumah, now in exile in
Guinea, with an invitation to respond!  If accepted, the resulting
Mazrui-Nkrumah exchange would have been a great boon to author and magazine
alike.  Nkrumah, however, diplomatically refused.  No matter.  Turning a
negative into a positive, <i>Transition</i> trumpeted the statement of refusal
as a triumph, an acknowledgment that Kwame Nkrumah had read Mazrui’s essay,
even if he declined to comment on it.  For decades to come, Mazrui would regale
audiences with the story of Nkrumah’s nonresponsive response.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The Leninist Czar essay was vintage
Mazrui, illustrative as it was of the author’s intellectual métier: comparative
political studies.  Its main argument was that Nkrumah patterned his public
life on Lenin, the indispensable leader of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. 
“There is little doubt that, quite consciously, Nkrumah saw himself as an
African Lenin,” Mazrui wrote.<sup>5</sup>  In support of this view, Mazrui
pointed to Nkrumah’s books, the most recent of which sported the title, <i>Neo-Colonialism:
The Last Stage of Imperialism</i>,<sup>6</sup> a riff on Lenin’s 1917 vade
mecum, <i>Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism</i>.<sup>7</sup>  Mazrui
also attributed Nkrumah’s emphasis on organization to Leninist influences,
although he took care to note differences in this regard.  Lenin’s chief
concern was to organize an elite revolutionary vanguard, whereas Nkrumah
stressed mass organization, which his Convention People’s Party was the first
in colonial Africa to put explicitly to anticolonial purposes.  Mazrui even
traced Nkrumah’s greatest legacy, his unrelenting advocacy of continental
African unity, to Leninist origins.<sup>8</sup>  Mazrui failed only to add what
he would not have known at time, as it was only later revealed:  Namely, that
Nkrumah reputedly slept under a portrait of Lenin above his bed, as the African
American writer Richard Wright, visiting the Gold Coast in the 1950s to gather
material for his book <i>Black Power</i>, squealed to United States diplomats.<sup>9</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>At one level, Mazrui’s essay had said
nothing particularly new.  From the literary standpoint, at least, Nkrumah’s
Leninism was no secret.  It was certainly evident in his writings and
organizational work.  Mazrui’s novelty was in combining the two, Leninist and
Czar.  In dubbing Nkrumah “the Leninist Czar,” Mazrui, as he was wont to do,
upped the rhetorical ante.  All good Leninists and students of Lenin knew, or
thought they knew, that Leninism had disposed of Czarism, definitively putting
paid to Russia’s royalist tradition.  Now along came the upstart Mazrui,
announcing that “while Nkrumah strove to be Africa’s Lenin, he also sought to
become Ghana’s Czar.”<sup>10</sup>  Lurking in back of Nkrumah’s “secular
radicalism,” Mazrui argued, were deep Czarist impulses inherited from various
sources, African and non-African.  For Mazrui, the key evidence of Nkrumah’s
Czarism was his assumption of the title Osagyefo, translated as Redeemer, a
title reputedly bestowed on him by Ghanaian royalty.  It was not that Mazrui,
ever the pragmatist with a high tolerance for inconsistency, objected to the
idea of a single individual combining the apparently contradictory ideologies
of Leninism and Czarism.  He was ready to concede that, “arguably … a Leninist
Czar was what a country like Ghana needed for a while.”  Nkrumah’s
transgression, rather, was what the pragmatic political scientist Mazrui prized
above all in human affairs, including in the affairs of state: moderation. 
“Nkrumah’s tragedy,” Mazrui offered, “was a tragedy of <i>excess</i>, rather
than of contradiction.  He tried to be too much of a revolutionary monarch.”<sup>11</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In the end Mazrui, with usual
even-handedness, split the difference.  He concluded that Nkrumah ultimately
was good for Africa but bad for Ghana.  “By leading the country to
independence, Nkrumah was a great Gold Coaster,” Mazrui offered.  “By working
hard to keep Pan-Africanism warm as a political ideal, Nkrumah was a great
African.  But by the tragedy of his domestic excesses <i>after</i>
independence, Nkrumah fell short of becoming a great Ghanaian.”<sup>12</sup> 
Mazrui’s use of the past tense seemed to connote death, physical as well as
political. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In fact, Nkrumah would live an additional six years after
being removed from power.  From his place of exile in Guinea, he had something
of a second political coming.  He became a theorist of what he called the
“armed phase of the African Revolution” and a partisan of the global Black
Power movement, which he considered part of the African Revolution.<sup>13</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui’s essay was widely read by the
global African literati.  The issue of <i>Transition</i> in which the piece
appeared sold out and went into a second printing.<sup>14</sup>  Meanwhile,
Nkrumah had turned down the offer to engage Mazrui, conveying his decision to
the editor of <i>Transition</i> through a secretary.  “Osagyefo the President
is fairly impressed with the scope of your magazine and would be pleased to see
copies of future issues,” the secretary wrote of Nkrumah, who continued to
insist he was Ghana’s rightful leader.  “The President has admired the literary
effort in Professor Ali Mazrui’s article ‘Nkrumah: the Leninist Czar’.” 
However, the punch line concluded, “I am afraid it has not quite provoked the
President into writing comments on it.”<sup>15</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Having failed to provoke Nkrumah into
engaging Mazrui, the staff of <i>Transition</i> turned to what they apparently
considered the best alternative.  They turned to K. A. Busia, perhaps the most
intellectually able of Ghana’s most zealously anti-Nkrumah politicians and a
future prime minister of his country.  (Busia was trained as an anthropologist,
at Oxford, like Mazrui, who of course was a political scientist.)  In an
interview, the first question the magazine put to Busia was his reaction to
Mazrui’s essay.<sup>16</sup>  Mazrui, Busia retorted, had turned Nkrumah into a
better Leninist than he actually was, making “Nkrumahism more orthodox and
marxist than was really practiced.”  Socialism, the anti-socialist Busia
continued, was “not compatible with the megalomaniac search for eminence of one
individual.”<sup>17</sup>  But Busia was no substitute for Nkrumah, who for <i>Transition</i>
remained the elusive interlocutor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Meanwhile, Nkrumah did comment on Mazrui’s
essay, although not for <i>Transition</i>.  Nor for public consumption. 
Several months after the Leninist Czar piece appeared, Nkrumah’s London-based
confidant, publisher and book procurer, June Milne, sent him a copy of Mazrui’s
new book, <i>Towards a Pax Africana</i>.<sup>18</sup>  After saying he was glad
to receive the book, the critiqueaverse Nkrumah continued apropos of Mazrui: “I
have never met him.<sup>19</sup>  I have no idea who he is, black or white. 
After the coup, he wrote an article in the college paper <i>Transition</i>, and
called me a ‘Leninist Czar’, and all sorts of nonsense.”  But having just
denied knowledge of Mazrui’s race, Nkrumah then went on to identify him, both
racially and politically.  “I think he is one of those black neocolonialist
intellectuals,” wrote the author of <i>Neo-Colonialism</i>.  “I will read what
he has written.”<sup>20</sup>  It is unclear if Nkrumah actually read <i>Towards
a Pax Africana</i>.  If he did, he apparently did not comment on it, as he
sometimes commented on the many works Milne and others sent him, generally
disapprovingly.  In the event, Nkrumah had not forgotten Mazrui.  Nor, it
seems, forgiven him.  Some eight months later another book by another
disfavored African intellectual, <i>The Gab Boys</i> by Cameron Duodu,<sup>21</sup>
provoked Nkrumah into returning to what he considered the sorry state of the
African intelligentsia, with Mazrui as part of the exhibition.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For African intellectuals, Nkrumah offered in
gender-specific language that effaced African women intellectuals,<sup>22</sup>
“still have the colonial mentality … these chaps are dependent on European
publishers, and they write things they think the white man wants to hear.” 
Only a Chinese-style cultural revolution, combined with a socialist revolution,
Nkrumah averred, could reeducate and redeem such individuals.  “Ali Mazrui is
one of them,” he added for good measure.  “See the trash he writes in <i>Transition</i>.”<sup>23</sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'> If Nkrumah regarded Mazrui’s essay as
trash, one wondered what he would have made of another article on the subject
of his downfall in the next issue of <i>Transition</i>.  Appearing under the
apparently interrogatory title, “Did Nkrumah favour Pan-Africanism?” the
article was written by Russell Warren Howe.  A white British journalist with
ties to the Central Intelligence Agency, Howe had served as Africa
correspondent for various United States publications, including in Nkrumah’s
Ghana, from which he was deported.<sup>24</sup>  Howe began by fastening his
sail to Mazrui’s wind, lauding the Leninist Czar essay as a “penetrating
article” that anticipated the main lines of his own argument.<sup>25</sup> 
Mazrui, on Howe’s telling, had “stressed the similarity between fascism (or
Czarism) and communism.”  From this premise, Howe concluded, “Ghana under
Nkrumah was a fairly typical fascist state.”<sup>26</sup>  Moving seamlessly
and promiscuously between fascism and communism, in a manner more reminiscent
of Hannah Arendt than of Mazrui’s essay,<sup>27</sup> Howe announced that
Nkrumah “had leanings towards a Communistic society, but seemed to be more at
ease with fascism in the end—albeit a fascism allied to Moscow and Peking when
it suited him, and seeking to be compared with the successful image of Lenin rather
than the disgraced images of Hitler or Peron.”<sup>28</sup>  No sooner had Howe
settled on a historical model for Nkrumah, however, than he rejected each one
as not quite suitable, and began to cast about for others.  After toying with
Joseph Stalin, the past master of necropolitics who eventually succeeded Lenin,
Howe turned to Benito Mussolini, the negrophobic Italian fascist dictator.  As
an archetype for Nkrumah, he posited, “the example of Mussolini seems closer to
that of the Czars or Lenin.”<sup>29</sup> </p>

communist garb, Howe then set out to demolish the most enduring myth about
him.  Contrary to popular misconception, Howe disclosed, Nkrumah was no
pan-Africanist at all.  Far from being a promoter of pan-Africanism, the former
Ghanaian leader was actually a wrecker of African unity.  Emphatically no, Howe
pronounced, answering the question posed in his article, “Did Nkrumah favour
Pan-Africanism?” </p>

Nkrumah for the fascist that he was and deconstructed the fallacy of his
alleged pan-Africanism.  It only remained for him to explain the makeup and
motivation of so bizarre a personality.  For this task, Howe turned to
psychobiography.  Nkrumah, he determined, was literally crazy, mentally
unbalanced.  He suffered from schizophrenia.  Never short of historical
precedents, Howe found yet another one to elucidate Nkrumah’s condition.  This
time, though, he did not have to venture out of Africa, having discovered his
model in Téwodros II, an Ethiopian emperor from the nineteenth century.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;

the Emperor Teodros III [sic] of Ethiopia, who had frankly psychotic periods.”<sup>30</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>At this point, Howe took leave of Mazrui,
whose analytical lead he claimed to have followed and whose trope had it that
Nkrumah, although in the end a bad Ghanaian, was a great African.  “I accept
the main lines of Mazrui’s analysis,” Howe noted, “but I think history will see
Nkrumah more (like Teodros) as a colourful scoundrel, a great ‘card’ (<i>Transition’s</i>
cover was symbolic) and a consummate headline-hunter rather than an activist in
history.  I do not see him as being a ‘great’ African.”<sup>31</sup>  After
charting the tragedy of Nkrumah, Howe ended his article on a note of farce. 
“Perhaps Nkrumah’s great tragedy—and this is not meant facetiously—was the
absence, in the present generation, of a lively and prosperous theatre in
Africa,” Howe allowed.  “The stage, rather than politics, would have been the
natural vehicle for a man of such eccentric and erratic talents and brilliant
pretences, with a great gift for being, at least temporarily, all or most
things to all or most people.”<sup>32</sup> </p>

truly is not meant facetiously – on the African political stage for a
generation breezily dismissed as a conman and a madman whose only potentially
redeeming feature, as a showman, had been aborted by the reputed absence of an
arena for the expression of his iniquitous gifts.  (Contrary to Howe’s
assertion, Africa had a theater.)  In the flood and fury of ink spilling that
followed Nkrumah’s fall from power, Howe’s article ranked high on the list of
the absurd.  It truly qualified as trash, the language Nkrumah used to describe
Mazrui’s essay.  Not just by comparison, but also on its own terms, Mazrui’s
essay was a model of credible (if debatable) analysis and balance, rendering
unwarranted Nkrumah’s characterization of it.  Even Nkrumah’s most rabid
critics, like the Ghanaian military men who staged the coup against him,
refrained from treading where Howe did.<sup>33</sup>  </p>

beyond the pale, unworthy of inclusion in a serious journal of African thought,

end of his rule—good, bad or indifferent.  The article was so intemperate,
tendentious and unbalanced that even the editorial pages of Howe’s newspaper,
the<i> Washington Post</i>, may have looked askance at it.  (By the time of his
ouster the US and Western press, whose governments strongly backed the Ghana
coup, had turned vigorously anti-Nkrumah.) </p>

serious journal of African thought, chose to publish Howe’s article becomes
pertinent.  It is unknown if Mazrui, who at that point was one of the journal’s
five associate editors (working alongside a single editor), had a hand in the
decision.  It seems clear, though, that Howe’s article was part of a larger
push to generate discussion of Mazrui’s essay.  That push included headlining
the “Letters to the Editor” section of the issue in which Howe’s piece appeared
with the news of Nkrumah’s refusal to engage Mazrui.  The letter of refusal was
published under the caption, “Literary Effort Admired,” which is what Nkrumah’s
secretary reported him as saying about Mazrui’s essay.<sup>34</sup>  Further

interviewer’s first question was about the Mazrui essay.  Unusually, the
following issue of the magazine (the one after Howe’s article) carried just two
letters to the editor.  The shorter one castigated Mazrui for asserting that,
in the period called Reconstruction after the US Civil War, the freed slaves
displayed “flamboyant ostentation.”<sup>35</sup> </p>

also seemed to be aimed at stoking the fire lit by Mazrui, but with a twist. 
Its author, Y. Tandon, taught in the Department of Political Science at
Makerere, as Mazrui did.  Tandon attacked Howe and defended Mazrui, although
the defense was mingled with mild criticism.  “Ali Mazrui’s article, to which
Howe apparently responded, was reasoned, well-presented and, after reading
Howe’s article, also a fair assessment of Nkrumah,” Tandon declaimed.  “What is
most irritating about Howe is that he thinks he can use Mazrui’s article to
prove his point; that, in fact, he too, like Mazrui, is denouncing Nkrumah—
only a little more so,” Tandon went on.  “The treatment of Nkrumah by Mazrui is
brilliant, if incomplete.  The treatment by Howe is simply vile.  The one is
academic, the other a specimen of the worst kind of journalism.”  Tandon
concluded with a warning.  “If <i>Transition</i> is to retain the respect of
its African readership, it has to be careful that it does not become another
instrument of the international press,” he intoned.  “We have already too many
international journals which can do the job for Howe and his likes.”<sup>36</sup>

be forgiven for concluding that Howe, making his maiden appearance in the
magazine, wittingly or unwittingly had become a foil, his article being so

ample space in the journal to set up the counterpoint between Mazrui, his

of many readers of <i>Transition</i> who seemed to think the magazine was using
Howe’s article to put Mazrui’s essay in a better light and, just as
importantly, to keep the discussion going.  Writing from the United States,
Aidoo, who was one of the few women to join the debate in the pages of <i>Transition</i>,
began with Howe before moving on to Mazrui by way of postscript.  “’Thank you’
to our big white father Howe for an extremely illuminating and rather fresh
analysis of Kwame Nkrumah,” Aidoo noted, tongue in cheek.  “Our ignorance was
extreme.”  In appreciation of Howe’s enlightenment, especially in the field of
psychiatry, she persisted in the same mocking tone, “we are going to send Kwame
Nkrumah to Bellevue (a hospital for the criminally insane in New York) as soon
as possible.”  In an aside, she then took aim at Mazrui as an enabler of Howe. 
“Incidentally, we are also grateful to our own Professor Ali Mazrui and all
other objective and non-partisan African intellectuals and journalists who make
the writing and publication of papers like Mr. Howe’s possible.”<sup>37</sup>  
Munhamu Utete, in another letter that appeared in the same issue as Aidoo’s,
dispensed with indirection, and sarcasm, and attack Mazrui forthrightly.  Utete
rounded on the Leninist Czar essay, denouncing it, Nkrumah-style, as so much
neocolonial sophistry and apologia, “utterly without value.”  Despite his
“spurious objectivity and fake scientism,” Utete offered, Mazrui reproduced
“all the innuendo, baseless insinuations, and propaganda slanders of world
imperialist and reactionary circles that Nkrumah oppressed the people of
Ghana.”  Objectively, Utete determined, Mazrui was allied with the coup makers
and their neocolonialist backers who claimed to have “liberated” Ghana.<sup>38</sup>

shooting down of Howe’s sewer-propaganda article on Nkrumah,” was lauded by Ken
Geering, writing from Britain.<sup>39</sup>  Mostly, though, Geering was
concerned to directly connect the contents in <i>Transition</i> with one of its
key sources of funding.  “As long as the banner of the Central Intelligence
Agency’s front organisation, ‘the Congress of Cultural Freedom’ appears on <i>Transition’s</i>
first page, however inconspicuously, however shyly, just so long will what is
in so many ways a fine magazine publish anti-African, American interpretations
of African events.”<sup>40</sup>  Geering had raised a very sore point.  The
Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), the Paris-based, anticommunist outfit and
cultural Cold Warrior that funded scores of organizations and publications
worldwide, had recently been exposed as a CIA front.  While the CCF leaders
were well aware of its underwriters, most recipients of its largess were quite
ignorant of the ultimate source of their good fortune.  It was no secret that <i>Transition</i>
was one of those recipients, and had been for a number of years.  When the news
of the CIA connections broke, the editors of <i>Transition</i> put out a
statement “paying tribute to an important benefactor of this magazine,” the
CCF, “through its ‘no strings’ grant.”  Without directly mentioning the
intelligence revelations, the uncharacteristically convoluted statement thanked
the CCF for its “truly impartial and disinterested” support “at a time when the
‘hidden (or not so hidden) persuasion’ fact or in all aid can so easily devalue
the integrity of grants [sic].”  The statement further noted that, in the wake
of the CIA expose, the Ford Foundation had assumed full financial
responsibility for the CCF, from which <i>Transition</i> continued to receive
support.<sup>41</sup> </p>

where the CIA left off was not good enough for critics like Geering, especially
since many former recipients, unimpressed by the changing of fiduciary guards,
had severed ties with the CCF.  “One would have thought that news of the flight
from the Congress of Cultural Freedom would have reached Kampala,” where <i>Transition</i>
was based, Geering acidly reproved.  “All over the world organisations are
hastening to dissociate themselves from this offshoot of the U.S. spy and murder
organisation, the C.I.A.  The game is up, the C.C.F. has come to the end of its
yard of cloth, and there’s no rope left . . . <i>Transition</i> should
disassociate too, from this foreign espionage group.”<sup>42</sup>   </p>

Ngugi wa Thiong’o) agreed with Geering.  “I remember hearing, quite recently,
that this great cultural organization,” the CCF, “received funds from CIA
pockets,” Ngugi offered satirically, in the manner of his fellow imaginary
writer, Ama Ata Aidoo.  Ngugi noted that <i>Transition</i> had recently called
attention to a “Project Camelot,” which directed CIA funding of cultural
organizations, and concluded: “I wonder how many other Project Camelots there
are in East Africa to-day!”<sup>43</sup>  <i>Transition</i>, he implied, was

was implied in other responses to Mazrui (and Howe).  Repeatedly, it was
insinuated, or outright asserted, that the attacks on Nkrumah were disingenuous
and unprincipled.  According to this view, Mazrui was in the service of
external forces, indeed anti-African forces, objectively if not subjectively. 
(There was consensus among the interlocutors, including defenders of Mazrui,
that Howe consciously served the neocolonialists.)  The revelation that <i>Transition</i>
had been getting CIA money – even if the editors of the magazine, like many if
not most recipients of CCF funding, were unaware of that fact – only
strengthened the critics in their conviction that the payer of the piper indeed
was calling the tune. </p>

Nkrumah in <i>Transition</i>, hard on the heels of Mazrui’s essay, seemed to
further bolster the view that the magazine had an animus against the ousted
Ghanaian president.  Some of those commentaries even seemed gratuitous. 
Consider, for example, a Freudian-inflected article on Shaka, the
nineteenth-century founder of the Zulu kingdom in contemporary South Africa. 
Having been silent on Nkrumah all along, the article suddenly and inexplicably
ended by attributing to him a “Shaka complex.”  (Like Nkrumah and Téwodros,
Shaka was labeled as mentally unbalanced by various European writers, some of
whom nicknamed him Shaka the Terrible, causing some Africans to respond with an
opposing moniker: Shaka the Great.)  James Fernandez, the author of the
article, thought Nkrumah mirrored Shaka in “his [Nkrumah’s] relationship to his
mother, his relationship to women, his driving and, in the end, self-defeating
ambitions.”  The title of Nkrumah’s self-written life story, <i>Ghana: The Autobiography
of Kwame Nkrumah</i>,<sup>44</sup> Fernandez informed readers, “is reminiscent
of the consuming ambition of Shaka—the nation become [sic] the leader’s wish
objectified.  Politics, for those driven by a Shaka complex, is no longer the
process of arbitration and maintenance of balance.  It is the creation of a
charisma and its imposition upon reality—a charisma let it be said which was
first possessed by the child in his mother’s eyes.”<sup>45</sup>  There seemed
to be no end to the historical personalities, in and out of Africa, Nkrumah’s
public life is said to have resembled.  Evidence of an anti-Nkrumah design in <i>Transition,
</i>for those seeking such evidence, apparently was everywhere in the magazine.

down on their counterattacks.  In Mazrui, whose essay they saw as the opening

“Nkrumahist,” as Mazrui joined others in doing.)  Mazrui, his pro-Nkrumah

misguided.   </p>

students in North America.  In a long coauthored letter to the editor of <i>Transition</i>,
the pair refused to be drawn into a discussion of the article by Howe, whom
they summarily dismissed in language similar to Howe’s own invectives against
Nkrumah.  Howe, they said, was “irretrievably deranged.”<sup>46</sup>  The
coming African revolution, Onoge and Gaching’a declared, would render people
like Howe mute and irrelevant.  “Unfortunately the Mazruis will still be with
us,” they lamented.  “It is to him that we must address ourselves.”  Mazrui’s
essay, the duo asserted, was “an excellent illustration of the misdirected
brilliance of much of current African scholarship.”  He was a “political
science with more politics than science” and, as such, guilty of many wrongs,
among them “magical verbal tricks,” “intellectual masturbation,” and
“scurrilous diatribes” against Nkrumah.  To Onoge and Gaching’a, Mazrui’s essay
was “a case of neo-colonial scholarship.”<sup>47</sup>  Their conclusion, and
manner of speech, was too much for the Ghanaian Maxwell Owusu.  Confessing that
he, like Mazrui, may be a “Eurocentric, neo-colonialist scholar,” Owusu scolded
Onoge and Gaching’a for using “vehemently abusive” language that was “unbecoming
of the budding African social scientists.”<sup>48</sup> </p>

Owusu (and Y. Tandon), the responses in <i>Transition</i> ran strongly against
Mazrui’s essay.  The critics included E. R. Ibira and K. Y. Waibike.  It may be
safely assumed that Ibira and Waibike, writing jointly from Kampala, knew
Mazrui personally, although the general tenor of their intervention suggested a
less than cordial political and intellectual relationship.  Ibira and Waibike
found Mazrui’s essay “obnoxiously fluent but intellectually hypocritical.”  On
reading the essay, they were “struck by a pervading sense of injustice and
cruelty meted out to one of Africa’s greatest sons – Nkrumah — by one of
Africa’s talented professors, but nevertheless whose talent is misdirected –
Mazrui.  Why does he rejoice at Nkrumah’s overthrow by an army clique motivated
by greed and financed by eternal forces?”  Accordingly, Ibira and Waibike
demanded to know: “On whose side is Mazrui?  On Africa’s or on the imperialist
predators?  Mazrui is one of the new Africa’s [sic] intellectuals who is a
failure.  He is a failure because he does not regard himself as being involved
in the African struggle, he shapes past history to dovetail into his newly
propounded theory divorced from reality and laughs, as a Lucifer would laugh,

was more than half again as long as his original Leninist Czar essay.<sup>51</sup> 
While “irritated” with his detractors, whom he waved off so as many “Nkrumah

his assessment of Nkrumah.<sup>52</sup>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;

likened himself to the emerging nationstates of Africa and Asia whose refusal
to take sides in the Cold War earned them the scorn of East and West alike.  A
“spirit of detachment in assessing Nkrumah and a spirit of nonalignment in the
cold war have something in common—they share the risk of being despised or
blamed by partisans on both sides.”<sup>53</sup>  His critics, Mazrui
suggested, had been unfair to him, in part because they had not taken the time
to read him carefully.  Perhaps, he added, they could not spare the time.  “I
realise that it is the business of revolutionaries to be in a hurry,” he
wisecracked.  “And many of my critics in your column sound like

star in the East African academy, had been greatly boosted.  While belied by
Nkrumah’s seemingly unruffled, nonresponsive response in <i>Transition</i>,
mediated by his secretary, Mazrui had even managed to raise the hackles of the
former Ghanaian president himself, although that was not public knowledge at
the time.  (Nkrumah’s private correspondence, in which he lashed out at Mazrui,
would not be published for another quarter century.)  Yet for all the ruckus it
caused, in many ways the most provocative thing about Mazrui’s nine-page essay
was its title.  Even so, it launched the first notable debate of a public
intellectual who so relished debates, and whose subsequent life in and out of

legions of detractors, albeit one irritating enough to warrant being castigated
on at least two occasions in his private correspondence.  In this respect,
however, Mazrui was not unique.  Nkrumah answered many other critics in his
personal letters, often in more sustained ways than he dissected Mazrui.  In a
few instances, Nkrumah seemed to try to convince (or at least engage) his
critics by sending them copies of his books and other writings, as he did to
Harry Bretton, a white professor in the United States who had written an
unfavorable “rise and fall” book on Nkrumah that came out the year after
Mazrui’s essay.<sup>55</sup>  From all accounts, Nkrumah made no similar
gesture to Mazrui.  If he had, Mazrui surely would have publicized it, just as
he publicized Nkrumah’s nonresponsive response to his essay.  It is known that
Nkrumah had a copy of Mazrui’s <i>Towards a Pax Africana</i>, which came out
around the same time as Bretton’s book.  But, as previously noted, there is no
indication that Nkrumah read or commented on Mazrui’s book.  After his choice
words, sotto voce, about the Leninist Czar essay, Nkrumah apparently took leave

and Nasser are reputed to have shared a vision of pan-Africanism that was, in
Mazrui’s language, “trans-Saharan.”<sup>58</sup>  But Nkrumah, at least the
exiled Nkrumah, seemed to doubt Nasser’s pan-Africanism (and his revolutionary
zeal), believing his real passion was panArabism.  Nasser, Nkrumah observed in
private to a correspondent on the death of the Egyptian leader, was “a

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>When Nasser died, Mazrui sought to
organize an edited book on his life’s work.  In view of the connections, and
contradictions, between the late president of Egypt and the ex-president of
Ghana, Mazrui wrote Nkrumah soliciting a chapter for his proposed collection. 
Undoubtedly, Nkrumah’s contribution would have been the star attraction of such
a book.  Publishing the subject of his controversial essay would also have been
something of a literary and political coup for Mazrui.  It would not come to
pass.  Once again, Nkrumah did not engage.  He failed to respond to Mazrui’s
invitation, his silence substituting for a written refusal this time around. 
The reason is unclear.  Perhaps Nkrumah, who was known to hold a grudge –
Mazrui did not – was giving the cold shoulder to someone who, from his
standpoint, had kicked him at the very moment he had been knocked to the
ground.  But Harry Bretton did pretty much the same (even if his book did not
generate the kind of discussion Mazrui’s essay did), which did not prevent
Nkrumah from initiating communication with him.  Perhaps also Nkrumah was not
then prepared to publicly share his real thoughts on Nasser; among other
reasons, he likely would not have wanted to antagonize Nasser’s successors, who
continued to sustain his family.  Again, too, Nkrumah’s failure to reply to
Mazrui was consistent with a policy he adopted on going into exile, a policy of
rejecting virtually all unsolicited requests for essays and interviews.  This
was the very principle on which he had refused to engage, in the pages of <i>Transition</i>,
Mazrui’s 1966 essay.  Furthermore, by the time of Nasser’s death Nkrumah’s own
health had deteriorated, a consequence of his undiagnosed, or misdiagnosed,
cancer.  In any case, Mazrui’s projected volume on Nasser apparently never
appeared, whether because of the inability to interest Nkrumah is unknown. </p>

April 1972 a Russian friend so informed Mazrui, as he was leaving a hotel in
Washington, DC.  Nkrumah had succumbed to cancer in Bucharest, Romania, where
he had gone for treatment months earlier.  Mazrui was “deeply moved” by
Nkrumah’s passing.  When Mazrui visited Romania months later, he found himself
“enquiring where Nkrumah had spent his last days.”<sup>61</sup>  These personal
reactions prefaced an article, appropriately enough in <i>Transition</i>, in
which Mazrui lauded Nkrumah’s foreign policy, including his attempt to mediate
the US war against Vietnam, as capturing “African aspiration.”  Nkrumah, who
was overthrown while traveling in Asia on his Vietnam peace mission, “lost
domestic power partly because he had internationalist concerns,” Mazrui noted.<sup>62</sup>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui’s romance with Nkrumah reached its
apogee with what would become his most identifiable intellectual legacy, and
the trope for which he is best known, that of an African “triple heritage”
consisting of indigenous, Afro-Asian Islamic, and European-Christian
civilizations.  First presented in 1986 as a BBC/PBS television documentary and
then as a book, Mazrui’s triple-heritage idea reached a mass audience
worldwide.  On seeing the television series, Gamal Nkrumah (named after Gamal
Abdel Nasser), Nkrumah’s son with his Egyptian wife, asked Mazrui how his
“concept of Africa’s triple heritage was different from his father’s
consciencism.”  Gamal Nkrumah had in mind Kwame Nkrumah’s book, <i>Consciencism</i>,
his major philosophical work.<sup>63</sup>  Published in 1964, more than two
decades before Mazrui’s television series aired, this book advanced an argument
strikingly similar to Mazrui’s, namely that the societies of Africa are a
synthesis of African, Islamic and Western cultural traditions.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In response to Gamal Nkrumah’s question,
Mazrui replied that his triple-heritage trope came from “three great
teachers.”  The first was Edward Wilmot Blyden, perhaps the outstanding black
intellectual of the nineteenth-century and author, in 1887, of <i>Christianity,
Islam and the Negro Race</i>, which indubitably anticipates Mazrui’s triple
heritage.<sup>64</sup>  His “second great teacher,” Mazrui told Gamal, was
Kwame Nkrumah, the lessons coming largely from <i>Consciencism</i>.  “My third
great teacher was my own life,” Mazrui finished off.  Growing up in the Indian
Ocean port city of Mombasa, Kenya, he “crossed those three civilizations
several times every twenty-four hours.  I was getting Westernized at school,
Islamized at home and at the mosque, and Africanized at home and in the
streets.  I was myself a triple heritage in the making.”<sup>65</sup>  It
remained for Blyden and Nkrumah to lay out, in historical, theological and
philosophical terms, the foundations of Mazrui’s lived triple heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Mazrui’s realization of his triple
heritage marked a disjuncture, including as it did a revision of his previous
views on Nkrumah.  At the center of this evolution in Mazrui’s thinking was
Nkrumah’s book, <i>Consciencism</i>.  Several critics of Mazrui’s Leninist Czar
essay had called attention to its neglect of <i>Consciencism</i>.  No serious
analysis of Nkrumah, the critics argued, could fail to take account of his
major philosophical work.<sup>66</sup>  Mazrui, as usual, had a ready
response.  “I do not think <i>Consciencism</i> is an interesting work,” he shot
back.  Quoting from his own inaugural lecture at Makerere, Mazrui went on: “the
most intellectual of all Nkrumah’s own works is <i>Consciencism</i> . . . Yet <i>Consciencism</i>
is also the least Africa-oriented of all Nkrumah’s books.”  Intellectually,
Mazrui also had a less than exalted opinion of Nkrumah.  “On the whole I do not
think Nkrumah is a particularly original thinker,” he offered.  Mazrui rated
Nkrumah “significantly below” the Tanzanian leader, Julius Nyerere, “in sheer
intellectual freshness.”<sup>67</sup> From this unpromising beginning, Mazrui
arrived at a much more hallowed view of Nkrumah’s mind a generation later. 
From the unoriginal thinker of his relative youth, Nkrumah was promoted to the
post of preceptor, the “second great teacher” of the mature Mazrui, after the
very intellectually imposing Blyden.  <i>Consciencism</i>, previously dismissed
by Mazrui as uninteresting and the least African-centered of Nkrumah’s works,
became one of two sturdy epistemic legs on which he rested his career-defining
triple-heritage trope, the third leg of the triad being experiential, that is,
Mazrui’s own life.  It was a remarkable about-face, but one Mazrui never
explained.  How then to explain it?  Had the mature Mazrui adopted as his
mentor an unoriginal thinker, and then taken inspiration in his uninteresting
and non-Afrocentric book?  That seems unlikely.  It is more likely that Mazrui
changed his mind about Nkrumah’s intellectual worth, and about the Africanist
value of <i>Consciencism</i>, albeit without advertisement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The reason for the reversal obviously had
nothing to do with Nkrumah, long since dead, and everything to do with Mazrui. 
In part, the explanation may have to do with location, and the experiences
derived therefrom.  Responding to critics of his Leninist Czar essay, Mazrui
had observed that they were all non-Ghanaians.<sup>68</sup>  He may also have
noted that many of those critics, although hailing directly from Africa, were
writing from outside the continent.  In fine, they were in the diaspora,
temporarily or permanently.  As the postcolonial African universities declined
in the 1970s and 1980s, along with the journals they sustained, including <i>Transition</i>,
many African scholars, including Mazrui, also joined the growing new African
diaspora in North America and Europe.  It was from his perch in the diaspora
that Mazrui completed his reexamination of Nkrumah, whose own political
consciousness was decisively shaped during his twelve-year-long sojourn outside
of Africa, as a student, worker and organizer in the United States and
Britain.  Mazrui never became an Nkrumah worshipper, as he had accused critics
of his essay of being.  He was too good a scholar to be uncritical of anyone,
and too good a Muslim to worship any but the almighty.  He did, however, in due
course come to a greater appreciation of Nkrumah’s mind and of his intellectual
(if not always his political) labor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The evolution in thought coincided with an
evolution in practice.  The diaspora-based Mazrui could hardly be described as
detached from struggles outside the academy, as his detractors previously
asserted; or as a neocolonial shill, as Nkrumah declaimed.  Remade in the
diaspora into an insurgent and transgressive organic intellectual, Mazrui
proved ever more willing, even eager, to enter the antinomian political arena,
the many causes he championed including reparations for slavery and colonialism
for black folk and Palestinian national rights against Israeli apartheid and
settler colonialism.  A pair of critics of his Leninist Czar essay, E. R. Ibira
and K. Y. Waibike, had rhetorically posed the question: “On whose side is
Mazrui?  On Africa’s or on the imperialist predators?”  The question had since
become academic.  Mazrui transparently was now on the side of Africa and
struggling humanity everywhere.  This Mazrui, the fighter of the good fight
based in the diaspora, was in part a product of engagements with Nkrumah and
his life and legacy.  Indeed, two Nkrumah-centered projects, the Leninist Czar
essay and the triple-heritage trope, may be seen as veritable bookends to
Mazrui’s public life, intellectual and political.  It was a significant part of
a significant life, Ali Mazrui’s interlocution with Kwame Nkrumah. </p>

himself reportedly selected Nkrumah’s Egyptian Coptic (Christian) wife, Fathia
Rizk.  The dynastic-like arrangement was made sight unseen, the couple first
encountering one another when the bride arrived in Ghana for the nuptials.  The
marriage, in 1957, the year of Ghana’s independence, lasted as long as the
Nkrumah regime.  Although correspondence passed back and forth, wife and
husband never saw each other again after she returned to Egypt.  Nor,
apparently, did Nkrumah see his children after going in exile. </p>
