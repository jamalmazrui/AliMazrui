<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:2.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The official language of almost every Constitution south
of the Sahara is European.  Sub-Saharan constitutional law is almost entirely
Eurocentric in that sense.  Every right, every civil liberty, has to be
interpreted in terms of its meaning in the relevant Euro-colonial language.  In
addition to the substance of the law being itself culturally derived from the
West, there is the additional embarrassment of the official language in which
the law is expressed - a special case of double-jeopardy! </p>

margin-bottom:9.3pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>              There are gains and losses in this interplay
between </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>language, law and constitutionalism.  On the Pan-African
side, it has enabled lawyers from one part of Africa, or even one part of the
Black world, to serve in another part.  One of the highest ranking justices in
Tanzania was at one time from the West Indies.  In Uganda, on the other hand, a
Nigerian judge was indeed Chief Justice in critical years after independence -
Sir Udo Udoma.  The fact that English was the language of law and
constitutionalism in the Commonwealth sometimes facilitated the interchange of
lawyers and judges across huge distances.  There were occasions when PanAfrican
solidarity was among the beneficiaries of this lingo-legal convergence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The Rule of Law in African countries has sometimes gained
from this lingo-legal convergence.  The shared legal traditions and shared
legal language have sometimes enabled lawyers from one part of Africa or the
Commonwealth to help defend dissidents in another part.  The convergence of
linguistic and legal traditions have also enabled African lawyers to construct
networks of solidarity with other &quot;jurists&quot; internationally.  In
Nigeria and Kenya lawyers have often been in the vanguard of defending human
rights and democratic processes, and have been partially protected from
excessive governmental revenge by the international networking of jurists and constitutionalists
abroad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> We define &quot;the Rule of Law&quot; as the legal
dimension of the democratic process - the dimension which seeks to ensure that
governmental decisions are impersonal and subject to legal restraint, and the
dimension which guarantees to the individual freedom from arbitrary government
and entitles the individual to &quot;due process of law.&quot;  The convergence
between European languages and legal traditions has often aided the Rule of Law
in this sense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> On the negative side, such lingo-legal convergence has
sometimes encouraged excessive dependence by a former colony upon the metropole
(the former colonial power) even for the recruitment of judges for African
courts.  Kenya is one African country which has been too slow in replacing
expatriate judges with indigenous ones.  The problem of expatriate judges poses
intricate problems for this whole issue of the Rule of Law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Is one truly being &quot;judged by one's peers&quot; if
the judiciary is still dominated by foreigners?  Of the three branches of government
(executive, legislative and judiciary), the judicial branch has often been the
least Africanized.  It is also the one which is the least susceptible to
indigenous languages.  While politicians have to use African languages in some
context or another, judges and lawyers in most of Black Africa need not know a
single word of an indigenous language.  What this means is that the judiciary
is not only the least Africanized branch of government in <u>personnel</u> in
many African countries;  it is the least Africanized branch <u>culturally</u>
in almost <u>all</u> African countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> And yet the great majority of the accused who came before
the courts have little knowledge of European languages.  The whole system is
basically a massive exercise in translation - often extremely bad translation. 
The concept of &quot;<u>due process</u>&quot; is diluted as a result.  Not many
of the accused understand either their rights, or what is going on in court. 
If Justice must only be done, it must also be <u>heard</u> to be done, then it
is seldom <u>heard</u> in the right language in most African countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:2.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Then there is the vexing question of whether expatriate
judges are more likely to be independent of the Executive Branch than local
judges.  This used to be a popular belief at one time.  It was assumed that a
judge in Uganda, who was a British citizen, was more likely to stand up to the
dictatorial government of the day than was a local Ugandan judge.  The language
policy which enabled British citizens to serve in African judiciaries was
therefore regarded as an asset for the Rule of Law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>     Empirically, on the other hand, the record of
expatriate judges is mixed.  It is true that one brave expatriate judge in
Uganda under Idi Amin gave a ruling against the regime and then fled the
country - rather than compromise.  On the other hand, expatriate judges in
countries like Kenya and Malawi have routinely acted as if they were an
extension of the executive branch - leading to rumours of massive government
manipulation of the judiciary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Nor must it be forgotten that some local <u>African</u>
justices have been known to stand up to their own governments even at great
personal risk.  One of the more tragic cases was that of Chief Justice
Benedicto Kiwanuka of Uganda, who in 1972 gave a ruling contrary to President
Idi Amin's preference - and paid the supreme price.  The Chief Justice was
picked up from his own chambers in Kampala by military thugs, and was never
seen again.  He was a martyr to the Rule of Law - and he was a native son. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The lingo-legal convergence (the shared language and the
shared legal traditions) may still be important in safeguarding the Rule of Law
in Africa, but the distinction between expatriate and local judges may be far
less relevant than was once assumed.  What about the persistent anomaly that
virtually all constitutions south of the Sahara are in European languages -
languages spoken by very few of the citizens governed by those constitutions? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The linguistic gap between the constitution and the
citizenry deepens the remoteness of the constitution, and may be a contributory
factor to the perceived irrelevance of the constitutional order in most African
countries.  It is extremely rare that African constitutions are translated into
African languages (even if the official version of the constitution remained
the original European one).  Most indigenous languages are therefore poor in constitutional
vocabulary - even such basic terms as &quot;fundamental law,&quot; &quot;Bill
of Rights,&quot; &quot;the right to privacy,&quot; &quot;civil liberties,&quot;
or &quot;secular state.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> U.S. citizens are constantly bombarded on their television
with terms like &quot;separation of church and state&quot; and &quot;the First
Amendment.&quot;  How many African indigenous languages can even translate such
concepts?  Here we have acute lingo-legal <u>divergence</u>, rather than
convergence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Africa is paying a higher price for Euro-constitutionalism
than Africa realizes.  The fact that African constitutions are almost
exclusively in European languages has slowed down the development of a new
constitutionalist culture in Africa.  African citizens are not learning to
think in constitutional terms, partly because they live in political systems
which stifle the development of indigenous constitutional vocabulary.  How many
indigenous languages have words for &quot;freedom of conscience&quot; or
&quot;collective responsibility?&quot;  Do African citizens have the remotest
idea of what their constitutional rights are supposed to be?  This <u>lingo-legal</u>
<u>divergence</u> has created a conceptual void in the intellectual universe of
the average citizen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.5pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> There is a conspiracy of silence afoot among enemies of
constitutionalism in Africa.  The silence has taken the form of not translating
the fundamental laws which are supposed to govern the lives of Africa's
millions of citizens.  The silence is politically and morally deadly. </p>
