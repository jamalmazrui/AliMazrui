<h1>Mazrui and Barkan: a tribute</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>2014 was a very bad year for African and
Africana Studies. The large communities of scholars that study and explore the
worlds of Africa and the African Diaspora lost two intellectual giants. The first
to go, on 10 January, while on a family visit to Mexico City, was Joel Barkan,
formerly a professor at the University of Iowa, but at the time of his passing
a senior associate at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.<sup><span style='color:#000084'>1 </span></sup>Then on 12 October,
Ali Mazrui, another giant, departed while at his home in Vestal, New York
outside Binghamton University.<sup><span style='color:#000084'>2 </span></sup>Within
one year, the college of scholars concerned with Africa lost two of its leading
lights. The two were separated by a decade – Mazrui died at 81, while Barkan
passed on at 72. Both had witnessed Africa come of age in its post-colonial
iteration. They watched keenly the growth pains of a maligned continent, and
prodigiously wrote about it with a zeal and insight that knew few parallels.
This much was clear – they were both attached to Africa with a contagious
philia. They were not polar opposites, nor could they be; paradoxically, their
differences resided within their similarities. In this brief essay, I explore
the legacies of these two titans and link them within Africa’s journey for full
membership in the community of nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:19.85pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Mazrui’s and Barkan’s origins could not have been more
different; they literally came from opposite ends of the earth. Barkan was born
of Jewish parents in Middle America – in Toledo, Ohio. Yet this kid from
America’s heartland would become an unabashed cosmopolitan. Mazrui, on the
other hand, was born a prince in the real sense of the word. He was a native of
Mombasa, scion of the Mazrui dynasty which ruled part of the Kenyan Coast and
managed to keep the British at bay. He came from a devout Muslim family,
although he was in many respects a liberal. Thus although they came from
different branches of the Abrahamic faiths, Barkan and Mazrui were joined by
religion. While Mazrui made the biggest leap from his traditional roots to
formal Western education, however, Barkan stayed closer to home. Barkan was
educated in his own cultural milieu. He attended Cornell as an undergraduate
and received his MA and doctorate degrees in political science at UCLA. In
contrast, Mazrui, initially a poor student, had trouble making it to college.
Once he got there, however, he graduated with a BA with Distinction from
Manchester University in the UK, going on to obtain an MA from Columbia
University and a PhD in Philosophy from Oxford (Nuffield College) in 1966, a
bare two years after Kenya won its independence from the UK. These early years
from their respective ancestral homes and traditions – and college and graduate
educations – had a profound impact on both men and forever shaped their
intellectual outlooks.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Location and identity</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>Even though Mazrui was born a Swahili, from
the coastal people of Kenya with a heavy Muslim and Arab influence, he was a
Brahmin. His family was conspicuously wealthy and powerful. His pedigree was
Arab-like although he was considered racially a black African.<sup><span
style='color:#000084'>3 </span></sup>He was born in British colonial Kenya even
though his family enjoyed substantial autonomy from the British colonial state.
The family’s vast land holdings were specifically protected from encroachment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>by the Mazrui Land Trust Act of 1914
(Chapter 289 of the Laws of Kenya), a colonial-era parliamentary law. The Kenya
government repealed the law in 1989, but a subsequent court ruling in 2012
restored the land to the Mazrui family. Mazrui’s social status – as a British
colonial subject from an autonomously wealthy and powerful family, was one of
the many dualities that would come to define him. Embedded in his person were
so many contradictions that it is remarkable he was able to harness all the
competing energies to become one of the leading intellectuals of our time. A
few examples will suffice. He was an African Muslim educated in the finest
institutions in the West. He embodied – as he later wrote – Africa’s triple
heritage (Mazrui <span style='color:#000084'>1986</span>), the documentary of
the same title produced jointly by Mazrui and BBC as a TV series with him as
the narrator. In it, Mazrui captured the reality of the African as an alloy of
three heritages – the indigenous African, the Islamic tradition brought through
jihad and evangelism, and the European colonial/Christian/capitalist encounter.
He was a child of all these traumas and a medley of their African fact. More
than anything, it is this work that crystalised in the mind of the world Mazrui’s
torture of the African soul, the roots of his faith, the basis of his liberal
Muslim outlook, and the brilliant cosmopolitan that he was. He was a product of
the contradictions of the Arab slave trade in Africans, of the brutal European
colonisation of Africa, and of the resilience of the African. He had a
love-hate relationship with the West, although his affection for the liberal
West clearly trumped any disquiet of the Occident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Barkan, on the other hand, was a child of the American
Empire. He was born during WWII, a contest that would catapult the United
States to global leadership and supremacy. During most of his life, the United
States was the most dominant state in world history. He died just as the United
States, though still clearly the dominant power, had become one of several key
players in an increasingly multi-polar world. Barkan and I often debated the
implications of the less dominant leverage of the United States in global
affairs. He remained convinced that the United States could be a force for
good. Even though the US was not an empire in the classic European nineteenth
and twentieth century sense – and certainly not in Africa – it was the most
successful state to come out of the Age of Europe, the epoch of white European
domination of the globe. In that sense, America could be seen as an extension
of the AngloSaxon domination of the world. For much of the post war period,
America came to see itself as the centre of the universe and its values as a
gift to the rest of humanity. Nothing exemplified this attitude better than the
use of human rights as a weapon in the foreign policy arsenal of the United
States. Democracy promotion and human rights crusades became an integral part
of Americana. These were the languages used by Washington to bludgeon states
and cultures that were either anti-Western or not liberal. Barkan, as a child
of this era, refused to subscribe to naked imperialism. Instead, he believed
that ‘soft’ American power could be used to promote political democracy and
basic freedoms around the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:27.15pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Thus both Barkan and Mazrui saw the world through the
historical distortions of their lenses – from differing vantage points. Mazrui
was opposed to the notion of the hierarchy of cultures. He did not think one
culture could be superior to another. He thought all cultures had something to
contribute to the common fund of human wisdom. There was no doubt that he was a
liberal who spent the vast majority of his life teaching and writing from the
West. Many of the societies that he defended against imperialism – like Uganda –
were either illiberal or outright dictatorships. He never made Kenya, his
native country, his intellectual home because of the hostility of the state
towards his support for democracy and human rights. This is where I believe
Mazrui’s nuanced pragmatism converged with Barkan’s more determined view of
democracy as an ‘Enlightenment’ project. Barkan believed that societies can
evolve into more humane polities. And he believed that it was the obligation – the
duty – of those in wealthier and more powerful countries to pay their ‘debt’ by
fostering democratisation in opaque, corrupt, and impoverished states. It is in
this sense that Barkan believed in the use of ‘soft’ American power abroad.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Career and scholarship</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>Barkan and Mazrui enjoyed academic careers
that took them to the pinnacles of higher education. Barkan taught in some of
the finest universities in America. In his early career, Barkan taught at
UC-Irvine before settling into a long and celebrated career at the University
of Iowa where he taught political science with a bias towards Africa. It was
while at Iowa that he emerged as one of the fathers of Kenyan studies in the
US. He established himself as a key voice on scholarship and policy on Africa;
writing and editing several books (<span style='color:#000084'>1976</span>, <span
style='color:#000084'>1984</span>, <span style='color:#000084'>1994</span>, <span
style='color:#000084'>2009</span>) and writing numerous articles for scholarly
and policy journals and newspapers. His works were analytical, carefully
written, and often laced with doses of policy recommendations and critiques.
Barkan left no doubt that he was not a bystander to history. He believed in
reforms to create stronger and more effective institutions. His particular
focus was the role that legislatures play in passing good reform-oriented laws,
holding the executive accountable, and forging a responsible political class.
He was concerned with elections and the role they play in creating a legitimate
state capable of projecting popular will to advance democracy and political
liberalisation. These are themes to which he often returned in his shorter
pieces in journals like Foreign Affairs and in opinion articles in newspapers.
Barkan’s pragmatic side was highlighted by his work on the ground in East
Africa when he served as the US Agency for International Development’s Regional
Democracy and Governance Advisor for Eastern and Southern Africa in 1990s. One
could say he fell in love with his work as he repeatedly returned to Kenya and
other parts of Africa after his tour to do short term projects on
democratisation, elections, and development for the World Bank, USAID, and
other agencies. On these trips, he would meet with numerous local academics,
senior politicians, US embassy officials, and common citizens to share ideas
and receive information. This is what he focused on mostly in the last stanza
of his life while based at CSIS in Washington.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Mazrui’s career was solely based in the academy. His world
was governed by ideas right from his controversial tenure early in life at
Makerere University before he ran afoul of Idi Amin, the late Ugandan dictator.
Kenya would not welcome him home because of his sharp pen, but the United
States took him in. His first stop was at Stanford and then Michigan where his
academic career truly blossomed. Finally, he chose Binghamton University, New
York, as his last academic home. He was also a visiting professor in many
leading universities. In all these institutions, including at Makerere, he
either held distinguished chairs or headed important departments. He was a much
sought after speaker and in 1979 he delivered the prestigious BBC Reith Lecture
famously entitled ‘The African Condition’. Widely regarded as an orator and an
unequalled wordsmith, Mazrui was a master of the turn of phrase. His witty and
humorous deliveries were almost as famous as his jarring debates in which he
challenged convention and mercilessly attacked some of the totems of the West.
In all, he was gripping and totally insightful. He could not be ignored. When
he spoke, African dictators and democrats alike listened. He was so prolific in
virtually every written genre that a compendium of his writings traverses large
swathes of the human intellect. He was such a towering intellectual that in
2005 the US journal Foreign Policy and the British publication Prospect named
him one of the world’s top 100 public intellectuals. Like Barkan, Mazrui moulded
and influenced generations of academics and policy-makers. Lofty rhetoric and
the seductive cadence were not Barkan’s forte but he was an agile debater on TV
and radio programmes and at academic conferences, where he was widely
respected. Like Mazrui, he got his message across and he had a messianic zeal
when it came to making the case for a more enlightened US policy towards
Africa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Barkan, unlike Mazrui, was not a controversial academic. He
did not seek to challenge the ideas of his colleagues the way Mazrui did.
Mazrui relished intellectual combat. There are many surviving and departed
academics – African and American – who are still smarting from his verbal jabs.
The late William Ochieng, a Kenyan academic who held unpopular views about the
role of the Mau Mau in Kenya’s independence, was one of those at odds with
Mazrui.<sup><span style='color:#000084'>4 </span></sup>A famous slugfest pitted
Mazrui against Nigerian Nobel laureate and writer Wole Soyinka after the former
attacked Wonders of the African World, the TV series by Harvard academic Gates
(<span style='color:#000084'>2000</span>). Soyinka, a close associate of Gates,
was upset by Mazrui’s review of the Gates documentary. These hot spats between
Mazrui and Soyinka go back to Transition, the Kampala-based leading
intellectual African magazine in the 1960–1970s.<sup><span style='color:#000084'>5
</span></sup>Another notable debate pitted Mazrui against Archie Mafeje, the
South African academic, where the latter bitterly accused the former of
advocating the recolonisation of Africa (Mangu <span style='color:#000084'>2008</span>;
Mafeje <span style='color:#000084'>2008a</span>, <span style='color:#000084'>2008b</span>,
<span style='color:#000084'>2008c</span>; Mazrui <span style='color:#000084'>2008a</span>,
<span style='color:#000084'>2008b</span>). Both Mafeje and Mazrui proved to be
effective pugilists, but the debate was not the finest moment for either of
them. Even so, such epic encounters came to define Mazrui. He was unafraid to
provoke controversy – in fact, he courted it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.65pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Barkan was the exact opposite. He preferred gentle
persuasion more in the tradition of diplomacy, which he greatly valued, rather
than the bare-knuckled world of university corridors. I suspect that Barkan’s
approach was influenced by his desire to keep doors open to policy-makers and
key diplomats with whom he had frequent contact. He always strove to reach them
at the individual level and sought to convince them of the wisdom of one policy
choice over another. He knew how sensitive diplomats and policy-makers could
be, and so he kept their confidences unless there was a compelling reason to
call them out. In contrast, Mazrui preferred the blunt instrument of public
denunciation but ironically ended up attracting senior policy-makers and officials
wherever he went by the passion and persuasiveness of his thought. Thus, while
Barkan straddled the worlds of diplomacy/policy and the academy, Mazrui stayed
within the academic podium and the written word to convey and foster his vision
of the world. Barkan could, however, take off the gloves and hit out at African
kleptocrats, as he did in a number of articles on Kenya under President Daniel
arap Moi<sup><span style='color:#000084'>6 </span></sup>and President Mwai
Kibaki.<sup><span style='color:#000084'>7</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Barkan’s academic and policy work was designed to educate
American academics, students, diplomats, and policy-makers about Africa and why
it mattered to the United States. Since his first trip to Kenya shortly after
independence, Barkan was convinced that Kenya could prosper and achieve a
larger destiny in Africa. He strongly believed that a more enlightened US
policy towards Kenya – supporting effective and accountable institutions like
the legislature and legitimate electoral systems – would solidify Kenya as an
anchor state in Africa. He worked prodigiously to make possible visits by
Kenyan academics, politicians, and diplomats to the United States to attend
meetings and be exposed to their counterparts. He believed that strong and
ethical Kenyan upper and middle classes were necessary for the incubation of a
viable democracy. He fought hard against US State Department views that
denigrated Africa’s place in its calculus. He wanted American diplomats,
politicians, and policy-makers to understand why Africa mattered to the United
States – for Africa’s sake and for the larger US interests abroad. To this end,
he nurtured many an African academic and introduced them to the larger worlds
of American academy, policy, and politics. He kept strong links with Kenya’s
young civil society and often collaborated with it: collecting data and
information for use in his policy advocacy as an academic and within the
corridors of power in Washington. I argued in a eulogy for Barkan that he was
the closest an American could come to being a</p>

margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>Kenyan without actually being one.<sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:38.25pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Mazrui wrote about many subjects, even trying his hand at
literature when he penned The Trial of Christopher Okigbo (<span
style='color:#000084'>1971</span>) a novel that critiqued the Nigerian writer
for allegedly betraying the larger Nigerian project and art by joining the
civil war on Biafra’s side. The works he produced early on in his career
painted a young man with large ideas full of intellectual ambition. He was
serving notice that he would be playing on the global stage with the biggest
minds of the era. His 1967 books (Pax Africana (<span style='color:#000084'>1967c</span>),
On Heroes and Uhuru Worship (<span style='color:#000084'>1967a</span>), and the
Anglo-African Commonwealth (<span style='color:#000084'>1967b</span>)) foretold
a controversial penmanship. Several other books, including The African
Condition (<span style='color:#000084'>1980</span>), Cultural Forces in World
Politics (<span style='color:#000084'>1990</span>), and Islam: Between
Globalization and Counterterrorism (<span style='color:#000084'>2006</span>)
solidified his iconic status. He was an intellectual pugilist in the best sense
of the word. While their styles were contrasting – and their reach different – both
Mazrui and Barkan wrote and acted with passion and conviction. One got the
impression they lived for their ideas and work. Each seemed prepared to defend
his work to the death. In the end, it must be conceded that each succeeded in
his chosen path and the uses to which he put his intellect. While Barkan closed
his life at a think-tank doing largely policy work, Mazrui’s career ended the
way it started – in the academy. Each hued to his strengths toiling at the
corner in which he was best suited.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Philosophy and worldview</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>Both Mazrui and Barkan were born and lived
during a time of roiling ideological ferment. Both men lived during the height
of the Cold War, and they saw the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of
the Soviet Union as well as the unification of Germany. But most importantly
for them, they witnessed Africa’s Independence Decade – the virtual political
liberation of a continent, except for Western Sahara. They saw the end of
Apartheid in South Africa. They were jubilant about Africa’s decolonisation,
but depressed by the inertia and dysfunction – dystopia – of many an Africa
post-colonial state. They watched as early experiments in liberal
constitutionalism collapsed under the weight and pressures of a scandalous
international economic order, ravenous tribal elites, and corrupt political
classes. In their place, one-party dictatorships and brutal military regimes
proliferated in the African continent as it entered one long night of tyranny.
Infrastructures collapsed, economies were brought to their knees, genocides and
pogroms became all-too common, and the African university virtually died.
Africa became a byword for human misery. But neither Mazrui nor Barkan lost
faith in Africa’s humanity and its ability to bounce back from adversity. For
Mazrui, Africa’s resurgence would be a matter of time. After all, the continent
had already endured two of the largest historical traumas the world had ever
seen: slavery and colonialism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Although Mazrui and Barkan came from contrasting cultural
milieus, they both believed – deeply – in human dignity. People like them – men
of their era – were generally forced by history to choose which side of the
political divide to inhabit. This was particularly true for men of ideas such
as themselves. For an African like Mazrui, the pressure to join the Marxist
column in vogue throughout sectors of the African intelligentsia during the
1960s–1980s was intense. One’s bona fides as a true African patriot depended on
which side of the fence one fell. Liberal ideologues were mocked as ‘capitalist
running dogs’. Even worse, they were viewed as traitors to the cause of full
African liberation from the West, capitalism, and exploitation. Mazrui, one of
the first Africans truly steeped in the literature of the West and its
politics, did not accept this easy schism. He thought that this dichotomy
demagogued the complexity of the African condition. The East African circles in
which he started his career were dominated by leftist academics, many of them
expressing an openly Marxist/Maoist/Leninist view of the world. But Mazrui
never ceded ground to them. He eschewed most forms of fundamentalism and his
worldview was decidedly liberal, although he remained throughout his life a
critic of the West.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Mazrui could be the consummate provocateur and truth teller,
especially in polite company. Many times he wrote to kill totems. For example,
although he held the Dr Albert Schweitzer Chair at Binghamton, he once said
that the revered doctor was a ‘benevolent racist’ for calling Africans ‘savages’
and ‘primitives’ and treating them in separate and unequal wards in
pre-independence Gabon.<sup><span style='color:#000084'>9 </span></sup>In the
documentary: The Africans: A Triple Heritage, Mazrui rooted for a black-ruled
state to inherit South Africa’s nuclear arsenal once Apartheid was defeated.
Blacks, he argued, would have nuclear arms for the first time in history and
could use it for leverage in white-dominated global affairs. A hue and cry
followed but Mazrui was unfazed by his American critics who included Lynne
Cheney, the Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities and wife of Dick
Cheney, the future Vice President under President George W. Bush. Though a
liberal – and a Muslim who was known to enjoy good wine – Mazrui was a fierce
critic of the West’s treatment of Islam and Muslims. He defended Islam, which
he saw as part of Africa’s rich heritage, from demonisation. But he also
virulently opposed Islamic fundamentalism and extremism. He believed that
sharia was not compatible with democracy. An equal opportunity critic, he
denounced Marxism as unsuited to Africa but was also deeply critical of
capitalism and its imperial exploitation of Africa. In sum, Mazrui opposed all
forms of domination and instead sought a new humanism for Africa – an ideology
grounded in liberalism but an economic system that was anti-imperial and
respectful of the dignity of Africans and Africa’s resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:26.4pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>Barkan, like Mazrui, had no time for Marxism. I think he was
never tempted, or seduced, by the logic of Karl Marx. A true liberal in the
American sense within the Democratic Party, he believed in the American
experiment with democracy and the potential for the United States to play a
constructive role in emerging states, especially in Africa. He was particularly
interested in three African states that he saw as anchors in Africa. These were
Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. He thought Egypt, the fourth anchor state,
was an important player, although he did not focus his work there. For Barkan,
the American values of democracy and the rights language could be used as a
link to cultures emerging out of despotic periods. But he was sensitive to
charges of American paternalism, or soft bigotry, under the guise of human
rights and development. He frequently argued that democratic values had to be
deeply embedded in the bone marrow of other cultures to succeed. Elites and
common people had to connect their own aspirations for freedom with these
values to legitimise any role that the United States could play through its
diplomatic missions and development agencies. The key to success would be a
press that was vibrant, a strong civil society, and an expanding middle class.
There is no question that Barkan represented the best of the American academy
studying and working on policy in Africa. His scholarship, work, and global
vision – unlike Mazrui’s – were not forged, or born, in protest. It was not
anti-imperial, nor did it have to be explicitly so to be a genuine giving of
self to the larger humanity. He took the best of the United States and shared
it with Africa.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Conclusion</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.7pt;text-indent:0in'>I will deeply miss both Mazrui and Barkan.
They were among my mentors and forebears in the academy. I learned a lot from
both, and I shared several platforms with them. I remember being on a panel
with Mazrui at the OAU in Addis Ababa in 1994. In front of us sat foreign
ministers and ambassadors of many African states. Mazrui did not mince words as
he blasted them for creating a refugee crisis in Africa. He decried the corrupt
and brutal post-colonial African state and wondered whether it would be washed
in rivers of blood. That was Mazrui – fearless and direct before the powerful.
In 2003, I invited him to address a truth commission conference in Nairobi when
I chaired the Task Force for the Establishment of a Truth, Justice, and
Reconciliation Commission. At short notice, he made the long journey from
Binghamton to Kenya and delivered an unequivocal endorsement for a truth
commission for Kenya. That to me underlined his commitment to a just society.
Barkan was no different. We spoke on several panels together, one of the last
coming at the annual meeting of the American Society of International Law in
Washington. He was engaging and invigorating. But he did not suffer fools well
either. Barkan’s concern for justice was well known. One of his last
preoccupations before he left us was the cases against Uhuru Kenyatta and
William Ruto for crimes against humanity at The Hague-based International
Criminal Court. He believed the two – who were declared elected President and
Deputy President of Kenya – were guilty of the heinous charges against them.
But he was aghast at the slow pace of the trials and believed that the Office
of the Prosecutor was unlikely to secure a conviction because of witness
tampering and poor investigations. These are the memories of my friends and
mentors that I am going to keep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:30.6pt;
margin-left:-.7pt'>I deliberately chose the contrast/complement of Barkan and
Mazrui to show how two leading scholars and actors on the African reality could
converge on the project of the continent’s renaissance. One was born free and
white in the American heartland. The other came into the world black and a
British colonial subject in the Kenyan Colony. Both became leaders in the
American and global academies on Africa. Mazrui’s was the voice of protest – exposing
the West’s machinations and vices against Africa and asking for fundamental
change in Africa-West relations. Mazrui told the world that he, and by
extension Africa, could stand in the most hallowed halls of the global academy;
that Africa was an equal in global affairs and should be treated as such.
Barkan’s claims were not that forceful, nor could they be. That is because he
saw himself as an outsider to Africa, but an outsiderinsider. He was acutely
aware of the limitations of the American expatriate and Western Africanist in
Africa. But it is what both Mazrui and Barkan did to advance the study of
Africa in America and the world that will live forever. Mazrui was deeply
involved in the African Studies Association (ASA), and even served as its
President. Barkan was a long term member and senior official of the ASA. Both
were ‘statesmen’ within the college of Africanists, the African Diaspora, and
Africans within the ASA. The passing of both giants leaves a unique void. Their
legacies – and their good works – will live forever.</p>
