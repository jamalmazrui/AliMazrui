living alone has increased my nostalgia for Africa.     Partly to compensate
for my not being in Africa, I have tried to create an African world around me
right here in Ann Arbor.  Two of my Ugandan wards (people whose education I
have supported) have come to visit me . Sam and Brenda are helping •to give me
a sense of family again.     1 also have a network of other African friends and
students around.   But as part of my new design I have also wanted a link with
an African university, It now seems fairly certain that, at least for a while,
I will have a link with the University of Jos in Nigeria, which is extending
its professional hospitality to me, with effect from early 1982. I will still
retain a base at the University of Michigan but I hope to spend several months
in Jos both in 1982 and 1983.    It is an exper.iment to see if I can survive
trans— Atlantic commuting of this order!   I am deeply grateful to both

of you may know that my lecture at Makerere University a year ago was on the
theme &quot;CAN UGANDA BE RE-DESIGNED&quot;?     This was given in December
1980 in the Main Hall at Makerere.      You may be interested do know that I
repeated the lecture at Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1981. The
central argument was that a devastated society presented not merely a calamity
but also an opportunity.    Because so much had been destroyed, it was possible
to be selective about what was to be rebuilt .   It was possible to pick and
choose about redesigning a new order — instead of trying to go back to the
situation before an Idi Amin abolished the old order.  Instead of
reconstruction, a society <img width=1 height=1 id="Picture 6227"

Jamal, our oldest boy, has been busy redesigning his own life and career .    Indeed,
the biggest booster in 1981 for the family was our oldest boy' s remarkable
academic adj ustment .      Jamal's last year in secondary school was his first
complete year as a blind person.      In academic performance it turned out to
be his best year at school, complete with school prizes.      He did so well
that major universities in the United States were falling over each other
trying to attract him — Harvard, Michigan, Princeton, M.I.T. , North— western,
Stanford. After a good deal of agonizing Jamal made up his mind <img width=1

src="Newsletter%2004,%20Eve%20of%201982,%20Redesigning%20Life_files/image009.jpg">and

kind of undergraduate training in engineering he had in mind .    His mother

brother Al Amin to the Michigania family summer camp. I also took the Uzoigwe

authority on this great man — and his significance for Africa!     I was asked

controversial! ) propositions before Turkish audiences . I suggested that while
Mustafa Kemal was indeed a hero of Turkey's political liberation from Western
Europe, he might also have been at the same time the architect of Turkey's
cultural dependency upon the West. This was partly because he thought the road
to economic modernization was through cultural Westernization — in contrast to
the Japanese belief after the Meiji restoration that economic modernization
could be accomplished without too much cultural Westernization. (Hence the
Meiji slogan &quot;Western Technique, Japanese Spirit. .</p>
