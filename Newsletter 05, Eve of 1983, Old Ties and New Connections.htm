done. 1 filed for divorce about a year ago and, barring the paperwork, the
divorce is nearly through. But you thought Molly and I had lived separately for
more than a year? Yes, you are quite right. Sorry for the confus ion. Molly
filed for <u>separation</u> (<u>not</u> divorce) in 1980 in the hope we would
get together again on her terms. As I was unable to accept her terms, I filed
for divorce instead; Now each is about to become single again, though of course
still sharing the bond of our three children. It has been a momentous twenty
years for both of us. Molly and I first witnessed the disintegration of Uganda
before we experienced the disintegration of our own relationship. We suffered

to moral blindness in ourselves .</p>

actor was good when he came for rehearsals——but he did not always turn up. The
playwright, Nuruddin, came to our home to investigate if Kim could and would
take R?.ageh. <sup>r </sup>s part instead of the Nigerian boy. Nuruddin gave
the script to Kim to look at (with Al 'Amin's help) . Nuruddin was not asking
Kim to memorize the lines . Yet in less than half—an—hour Kim recited to
Nuruddin from memory a whole passage from one of Raageh 's speeches. The
playwright——somewhat taken aback—— exclaimed: &quot;You are hired, Raageh!
&quot; A new theatrical coll eague was promptly recruited . But it was not only
Kim who had his debut on the live stage. Kim's father was also hired as the Narrator
in the same play. However, Kim managed to outshine his Daddy quite
convincingly. A star was born on that dimly lit stage at the University of Jos

theory was that the Kenyan authorities had been offended by a play Al—Amin (a

mystified by the actions of the Kenyan authorities. This young man is no danger
to anybody. I hope our Government will reconsider its actions. Al—Amin's health
poses a further risk to him——he has asthma, high blood pressure and a heart
condition. Conditions in captivity could endanger his life, or expose him to
the peril of paralysis . If you share our concern <img width=1 height=1

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:32.65pt'>This entire experience of doing
a documentary for television has opened</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:55.45pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:4.3pt'>up a whole new medium for me. The BBC has expressed
an interest in my doing further documentaries for them. My Zimbabwe documentary
was shown twice in London and was also televised in the USA on the MacNeil/
Lehrer Report. My BBC producer, David Harrison, was a tower of strength in the
production. If all goes well, I shall look forward to working with him on other
television proj ects in the future.</p>

return to Nigeria in January . I was privileged this August to meet and chat in
Lagos with the Head of State, President Shehu Shagari. We discussed mainly two
subjects——the crisis within the Organization of African Unity and problems of
stability in East Africa. I shall be watching keenly Al—Haji Shagari 's
election campaign this coming year. Will he have another term of office as
President? His chances are good—but 1983 has the secret definitive answer
hidden in its temporal bosom .</p>

guest—house at Jos in 1982 was called the White House! Less grand than its
name—sake but it was fun: We had great company there. 1 100k forward to a
re—union with our White House friends in Jos . I have also missed Isawa and
Margaret Elaigwu, Nuruddin Farah and his theatrical group, colleagues in the
Department of Political Science, the Vice—Chance110r and his wife, the students
of Jos, Bolaji Akinyemi of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs and
Gerald Moore, who once taught Molly in a graduate course at Makerere University
in Uganda. Gerald is now professor of English at the University of Jos. It is a
small world!</p>
