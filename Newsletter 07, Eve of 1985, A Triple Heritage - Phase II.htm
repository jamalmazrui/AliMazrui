&quot;bosses&quot; -- the University of Michigan in the United States, the
University of Jos in Nigeria, and a television project called &quot;<u>THE
AFRICANS</u>&quot; being jointly produced by the British Broadcasting
Corporation and Public Broadcasting Service in the United States (through WETA
in Washington, D.C. ). My! Have they kept me busy! 1 have been crossing the
Atlantic and the Mediterranean multiple times throughout the year. We have been
filming all over the continent. The range is from the castles of Ethiopia to
the camels of Somalia, from the wheat of Tanzania to the wines of the Ivory
Coast -- some would say from the wilderness of exile to the wildness of the
domestic scene. The theme is Africa(s Triple Heritage--indigenous, Islamic and
Western influences.</p>

television series will tell the story of Africa through my eyes, but certainly
the range of experiences we have had is wide.   In one West African village we
asked for a menu at a canteen. We were told that there was no paper menu, but
monkey stew and bush rat soup were available. I then discovered that strictly
on food I was more Muslim than African, perhaps simply more East African than
West African or Zairean. I could not make myself order either monkey stew or
bush rat soup.     But my English producer put me to shame! &quot;May I have
rat soup with a cold beer, p lease? <sup>I </sup>' He ordered.   1 knew then
what breed had built the British Empire-—the tough and the <img width=1

My producer's beer was <u>not</u> cold--but his soup was decidedly rat soup! He
consumed it without ostentation--just an aspect of the local <img width=13

was almost ashamed of my own Islamic inhibitions on diet ! My West African and
Zairean brethren have almost as wide a range of &quot;meat&quot; dishes as the
Chinese have. And yet, if on the issue of food, I am more Muslim than African,
am I, on the issue of <u>drinks</u>, more African than Muslim? Good question
for the triple heritage.</p>

to time created headaches for the BBC and WETA. I have on occasion been ready
to give public lectures at local universities at times when the film-makers
preferred to have me available for television work instead! Some passionate
debates have occurred, but with a lot of goodwill to go round.  1 did win the
battle to give a lecture at the University of Addis Ababa--but Ethiopian
political prudence resulted in the indefinite postponement of my lecture. On
the other hand, Somalia authorized a somewhat controversial lecture on
&quot;African-Arab Relations The Somali were prepared to debate my thesis about
&quot;Somali expansionism' , as well as my thesis that the Amhara were closer
to the Arabs linguistically than the Somali.     The world of dialogue is full
of surprises,     I was impressed by the candour in Mogadishu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.45pt'>My BBC/WETA filming tour also
took me to Kenya. In Mombasa we visited some of my old haunts -- including the
little playfield by the side of Fort Jesus where I used to play soccer as a
boy.  They are still playing soccer on the same little patch of land, with the
Fort on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other.     It was a nostalgic
visit.     It was also wonderful catching up with my brother Harith, with my
sisters in Mombasa, and with my friend, Sharif f Kimwinyi. Many friends and relatives
helped with the BBC filming of Mombasa.   Incidentally, the television series
will be on the screen in Britain and the U.S.A. in 1986.</p>

12.1pt;margin-left:4.3pt'>My 1984 visit to Zanzibar was surprisingly even more
nostalgic for me than Mombasa.   Being in Zanzibar during the fast of Ramadhan
took me back decades. My most startling experience in Zanzibar in 1984 happened
on I dd el Fit r, the day of breaking the month-long fast. I was walking out of
the official celebrations, which had been held in one of the palaces of the Sultan
in the <u>ancien</u> <u>regime</u>. A man dressed in full Arab
regalia--colourful and resplendent - -was looking at me intently. He could then
bear it no more. He came towards me and said in Kiswahili <sup>t </sup>'I am
sorry, Sir, but who are you?&quot; <img width=1 height=2 id="Picture 36539"
src="Newsletter%2007,%20Eve%20of%201985,%20A%20Triple%20Heritage%20-%20Phase%20II_files/image008.jpg">&quot;My

Mazrui? <sup>tl </sup>he enquired.  &quot;Yes,&quot; I replied.</p>

align=left hspace=12>And then, to my astonishment, the man burst into tears and
embraced me like a long lost brother. It turned out that I was indeed a
&quot;long lost brother&quot; . His father--Sheikh Abubakar Bakathir--was my
father's best friend when I was a child. Sheikh Abubakar looked after me in the
1930s when my father left on a slow pilgrimage to Mecca. I was then only a tiny
child. The Sheikh also looked after me during World War Il when women and
children were evacuated from Mombasa (under threat as a major port) - -and
Zanzibar played host to my family. As a child I grew so fond of my Zanzibar i
&quot;uncle&quot; that when he died suddenly towards the end of the war, I wept
for three days. And now in 1984--right there in front of me and my BBC
colleagues--was Sheikh Abubakar!s son, Abdullah, in tears at finding me again!

kind.    I was in the audience in Moshi on the mainland awaiting a speech by
President Julius Nyerere .      The president arrived and sat down. As he was
being introduced his roving eye caught mine.      I was surprised that he
recognized me at once in spite of my grey hair (he had not seen me for more
than a decade).     Later on, at another ceremony, he interrupted what he was
doing, and rose to come and say hello. It was very pleasant to chat with him
again. In fact, I thought I was in disfavour because of my reservations about
some of his policies, but I was reassured.     Later on I heard Nyerere give
one of the most eloquent speeches I have ever heard in Kiswahili. He had no
notes.   It was an impressive exercise in the oral tradition.  I am delighted
he has since been elected Chairman of the Organization of African Unity.</p>

race by two days. For us in the family it was a great week--the week when my

Edinburgh were--by a curious alliance--the founding dignitaries of the Academy
way back in the early years of Ghana's independence. As Honorary Fellow I was
joining the ranks of Prince Philip! By another curious coincidence, the Duke
and I met at the University of Manchester in England precisely in the year when
the Ghana Academy of Sciences was born (1959). Why was I being introduced to
His Royal Highness so long ago? Simply because I was President of the African
Students' Association of the city of Manchester at the time.   But neither the
Duke nor I knew at the time that the Ghana Academy's honorary fellowships would
one day be one of the accidental bonds between us! ! He was the first Honorary
Fellow ever elected!</p>

align=left hspace=12>I believe 1984 was also the twenty-first anniversary of my
own first visit to Ghana.     If my memory serves me right, it was in 1963 that
I arrived in Accra as one of the young scholars invited to Ghana by Kwame
Nkrumah, W. E. B. DuBois and Willie Abraham to discuss the proposed project of
launching an <u>Encyclopaedia Africana</u>.  It was a vision of Pan-Africanism
at the academic and intellectual level.     Nkrumah did not last long enough in
power to see the project through, but a real start has now at last been made
towards that old visionary goal of twenty years ago.     The Organization of
African Unity has also given its blessing to the project, I understand. The
baby is in the process of being born, but more help is needed.</p>

the role of soldiers in Africa, but our differences are in the best academic
