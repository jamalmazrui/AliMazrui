many times in different countries  usually because of some misunderstanding
about our credentials as to where we happened to be.     Sometimes we have been
arrested by soldiers — fully armed and on the ready .    But matters have
always been sorted out in the end — and there have been lots of smiles and
handshakes to go round at the end of the day.</p>

it as high as he could. I then raised the alarm &quot; Andrew is sinking ! We
rushed towards him — first rescuing the camera! ! We then pulled him to safety.
No, it was not quicksand afterall . was <u>mud</u> sucking him in on the sea

the press conference — fol lowed Nimeiri and me as we chatted across the

at Mulago hospital in 1967 in Uganda. Al 'Amin was so sleepy that his mother
could not keep him awake long enough for breast—feeding. He just dozed off .   In

text-indent:42.5pt;line-height:94%'>I was in England when Margaret Thatcher's
government at last confirmed Its decision to withdraw from UNESCO, inspite of
appeals from most of Britain's friends (apart from the United States) . It was
a sad day for Britain's role in the wor 1 d — and indeed for Britain's
independence .</p>

Government , UNESCO still has a lot of friends In Britain. And the media tried
to be even handed. BBC radio confronted me with one of the Editors of <u>The
Daily Telegraph</u> (a right—wing newspaper) to debate UNESCO. The gulf between

this, I shall soon need Valerie Buckingham of BBC Publications to help me prune
•this Newsletter   just as she helped me cut out 35, 000 words from my latest
book! I had better stop before Valerie's services become necessary . (
Incidentally, the main reason why we had to get rid of 35,000 words from my
book was to make room for more than 200 pictures! Not a bad bargain at all! )</p>
