of African ambassadors to Washington attended the event, including the new
Kenyan ambassador, Hon. Denis D. Afande, and the Ugandan ambassador at the

has done very <sup>t</sup>ell in North Aærica, Africa, the Caribbean, the Arab

primary reason could be that European television had decided that one       series
on Africa was quite enough - and they had already bought the     series called <u>Africa</u>,
narrated by the distinguished British Africanist historian, Basil Davidson. me
two series are entirely different from each other (partly because Basil and I,
though friends, are tm very different observers of Africa) . This is quite
apart from the distinction betæen a sympathetic outsider like Basil and a
native of the continent like myself. Nevertheless, many continental European    stations
seem to have decided that one series about Africa was quite enough! !</p>
