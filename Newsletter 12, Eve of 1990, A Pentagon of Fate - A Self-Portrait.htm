political mission as well as an academic one.    The political mission was to
address a national conference on probl ems of peace, consisting of Sudanese
drawn from al l regions and all walks of life, and held in the Great Hall of
Friendship in the capital . The conference (officially known as &quot;the
National Dialogue&quot;) subsequently submitted a Report to the Head of State,
General Omer el Bashir, with a specific agenda for national reconciliation.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was involved the following month in a
pre-mediation effort to bring General El-Bashir into direct negotiations with
John Gorung of the Sudan People's Liberation Army in a neighbouring country.  Prospects
were not good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.45pt;margin-bottom:11.6pt;

audience in October. Actually I had two separate sessions with him, covering a
wide range of subjects about Sudan.   1 also added my voice to the appeals both
for peace and for the release or fair trial of political prisoners, including
the former Prime Minister Sadig el Mahdi . The President gave me a patient and
gracious hearing . Some detainees were later released, but other forms of
repression persisted.</p>

the Association of Arab Universities and the University of Khartoum. The
symposium had a more substantial response from the Arab world than from Black
Africa. There were a number of reasons for this imbalance. But was one of those
reasons the sheer austerity and enforced sobriety of the city of Khartoum?
Non-Muslim members of the jet-set prefer venues of conferences with lavish
restaurants, carefree nightclubs and availability of alcohol in the evenings.
Has Sudan's capital become too austere for non-Muslims since President Numeiry
initiated the neo-Islamic September laws? I am just speculating. Let us check
the hypothesis against the level of attendance at the next session of the

Africa's effort to exert counter-leverage on the citadels of power in the

least from my point of view. The invitation from the University of Jordan came
more than a year ago as a direct result of the showing of my TV series , <u>The
Africans</u>, in Jordan in Arabic. The Jordanians sent me a ticket in 1988 with
the invitation to turn up in Amman in person. Unfortunately the dates clashed
with the invitation from the Central Bank of Uganda for me to give the first
Joseph Mubiru Memorial Lecture in Kampala on &quot;Banking and Money&quot; in
October 1989. I turned down the Jordanians in order to go to Kampala, for both <u>personal</u>
and <u>political</u> reasons.</p>

and was commissioned mainly by the British Commission for Racial Equality.   The
theme was freedom of expression in relation to Salman Rushdie's <u>The Satanic
Verses</u>.    Even for me, who fully understood the reasons behind the outrage
felt by Muslims, the depth of feeling shown at the conference against Rushdie
was awesome . Especially strong were the emotions of British Muslims of South
Asian origin. They reminded me of the powerful anal ogy I had heard in Pakistan
when I visited Lahore and Islamabad in November 1988. &quot;It is as if Rushdie
had composed a brilliant poem about the private parts of his parents, and then
recited the poem in the market place to the cheers and laughter of strangers !
These strangers then paid him money for all the jokes about his parents'
genitalia&quot; . It was a concept of <u>treason</u> in a special sense.</p>

was joined by African Studies Cent res in the United Kingdom and a number of
British publishers with strong African links . The agenda ranged from the book
famine to Africanist museums .   In many ways this meeting was the most
Pan-African in scope of all the five meetings I attended in Europe in 1989,
