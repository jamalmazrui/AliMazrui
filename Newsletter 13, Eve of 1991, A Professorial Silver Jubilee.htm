year did re—capture some important points in my career . It also opened up new
professional experiences. The most important moment of nostalgia was a visit to
Makerere University in Uganda — which was where I first became a professor
twenty five years earlier. My newest experience of 1990 was the drama of a
visit to the Republic of South Africa — a visit with its own moments of
excitement and anxiety! I shall return to the emotions of Uganda and South
Africa shortly.</p>

a different kind of pilgrimage. Returning to Spain recently was a celebration
of something even older than my professorial career. I first went to Spain in
my pre—undergraduate days in the 1950s — when I had just begun courting Molly
(or was she courting me?) ! ! Molly and I had a memorable time in Spain as part
of a group of student—tourists from Huddersfield Technical College where Molly
and I were preparing for university entrance in Britain. As an African student
in Valencia I was such an unusual sight in those days that the local press got
interested — and arranged to have me interviewed! Perhaps that was the
beginning of my flirtation with the Western press!</p>

walked on the beaches of northern Spain in the 1950s (young black male, young
white female) there was no hostility — but there was a lot of unabashed and
open curiosity. children followed us in wonderment! They were far less
threatening than th <sup>r </sup>children in Tennessee Williams' play <u>Suddenly

of Sociology sponsored by the International Sociological Association, and held
at the University of Madrid and opened by His Majesty King Carlos. There were
some four thousand sociologists from around the world. I chaired one session on
&quot;Comparative Ethnicity&quot; and presented a paper on another panel on
&quot;Religion and Politics&quot;. Although I was supposed to be co— convener
of the panel on ethnicity, in reality most of the work before the Congress had
been done by Professor Marshall Murphree of the University of Zimbabwe. All I
had to do at the Congress itself was to make some last—minute decisions about
panelists — and then preside at the session. My deepest gratitude to Professor
Murphee. At the Congress itself I was elected to the Research committee on
Religion and Politics.</p>

was 32 years old. I was being promoted in a meteoric rise after less than two
years as a lecturer. To the present day I have never been a Senior Lecturer, or
a Reader, or an Associate Professor. That portion of my career which was below
the rank of a full professor has remained less than two years long in all.</p>

in 1965 — and the United States confirmed Makerere <sup>l </sup>s judgement in
the 1970s with offers of tenured appointments from varied universities. In 1990
the Makerere community turned up in multitudes to help me celebrate 25 years of
continuous professorial activism. What an exhilarating moment! What a humbling
experience!</p>

instance was a conference in Kampala on &quot;Academic Freedom and Social
Responsibility in Africa&quot;, sponsored by a Pan—African organization called
CODESRIA based in Dakar, Senegal, and by Makerere University and the Center for
Basic Research in Uganda. The conference was opened by president Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda. In his speech the President quoted my definition of an
intellectual which I had first used in a debate in the Town Hall in Kampala
with Mr. Akena Adoko, who was then the Head of Intelligence under the first
administration of Milton Obote. I had defined an intellectual in 1969 as
&quot;a person who has the capacity to be fascinated by ideas and has acquired
the skill to handle some of them effectively&quot;<img width=3 height=3

11.25pt;margin-left:2.85pt'>In November 1990, President Yoweri Museveni got the
first part of my definition correct - that an intellectual was &quot;a person
who has the capacity to be fascinated by ideas&quot; . The President then added
and &quot;one who can juggle ideas&quot; . In the discussion which followed I
promptly corrected President Museveni! I also asked him whether he permitted
only ideas expressed <u>verbally</u> (i.e. in words) <img width=8 height=2
id="Picture 8296"
src="Newsletter%2013,%20Eve%20of%201991,%20A%20Professorial%20Silver%20Jubilee_files/image002.jpg">or
whether he would permit opinions experienced <u>behaviorally</u>, like burning
the flag or a student's boycott of classes. President Museveni (like President
Bush) advised against burning the flag! What was particularly impressive about
Museveni was his readiness to make himself available for such a prolonged and
frank discussion with academics after his speech opening the conference. The
entire debate about academic freedom in 1990 was a worthy celebration of my own
humble Silver Jubilee. Afterall, my confrontation with Akena Adoko in the Town
Hall in 1969, chaired by the Mayor of the City of Kampala, and televised at the
time, had indeed been on the related subj ect of &quot;The Role of the African
Intellectual in the African Revolution&quot; . The question of intellectual
freedom had also been central in the 1960s.</p>

d is— Ugandanization of my domestic life. Almost continuously since my first
son was born, my household had always included a Uganda—born member. Until my
marriage came to an end, the Uganda—born members of rny family were my own sons
(Kenyans by nationality but Ugandans &quot;by birth&quot; ) <img width=3

the children. After a brief gap my household had Uganda—born members once again
— but this time Ugandans themselves. The Kiberu sisters filled the Uganda gap
in my Michigan life; and Sam Sebina and later Gasana Berthas looked after me on
the campus of the University of Jos. Of course my Ugandan wards did not replace
my Uganda—born sons in life. This wider Ugandan connection enriched my entire
existence ,</p>

There was a new emptiness, sad and bewildering, at home - precisely when,
professionally, I was celebrating my Silver Jubilee as a professor. I shall

wanted, and had to have the option of taking my English wife with me to South
Africa. I added the last condition to test the system at its most absurd. My
prospective hosts would write back to say that they could guarantee racially
mixed audiences, and were prepared to take the risk with whatever I wanted to
say. But coming to South Africa with my English wife would make us liable to
their so—called Immorality Laws and Mixed Marriages Act — imperil Mrs. Mazrui
and me. So I never went to South Afriea.</p>

In the course of my coffee hour with the academic staff at Cape Town someone
referred to a report about my Desmond Tutu lecture which had appeared in an
Afrikaans newspaper. The newspaper had referred to what I had said about gender
relations in Africa. That simple reference during the coffee hour provoked a
serious debate about whether African culture was more or less liberating for

in London only the previous month. I did not expect to see it so soon . But
actually it was indeed available already in a local Cape Town bookstore. I
checked that out personally — and bought myself a copy from the shop as a
memento. It was a mark of the changed situation in <u>censorship</u> that my
book was available so promptly in South Africa. In the old days the Censorship
Department would presumably have taken months to decide whether or not the book
should be banned! The book that accompanied my BBC Reith Lectures, <u>The

seemed fundamentally segregated. The Group Areas Act took its toll — separating
people's homes by huge distances . Even more fundamental was the apartheid of
power — the difference between powerful whites and still basically powerless

markedly. Some expected a social revolution of young Blacks ; some expected a
general moral breakdown as the violence of Natal spread elsewhere; and still
others simply expected the ANC to be forced to resume armed struggle. Almost
all ANC activists I spoke to thought the Government was dragging its feet even
on such minimal issues as the release of political prisoners and amnesty for
those in exile to enable them to return. Never was a country so incredibly <u>beautiful</u>

Was the distribution of this document a deliberate attempt to discredit rne?
Was Lord Bauer's attack on me being distributed more widely than the committee?
I wrote to the scholar at Columbia to seek clarification. At first she denied
having anything to do with the distribution of Lord Bauer's attack. But when I
provided proof that the document was being distributed with the Columbia

the year after my appointment as professor. I was one of the speakers in a
major public rally on &quot;Revolution and Response&quot; . Other speakers
included Cheddi Jagan, the distinguished Marxist opposition leader from Guyana
and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later became President Jimmy Carter's National
Security Advisor, The mid—1960s were years of big debates about politics and
cosmic issues about the future — and that Toronto rally was one of my most

Ontario Museum in Toronto invited me to give a special public lecture on
&quot;Africa's Contributions to World Civilization&quot; . It was part of a
programme surrounding a controversial exhibition on Africa at the museum.
Although the Museum charged a hefty admission fee to my lecture, there was
clearly enough Canadian interest in Africa 's contribution to civilization that
the lecture hall was filled.</p>

distinguished law schools which included Harvard, Yale, Stanford as well as

marketing credibility would suffer enormously if he arrived at a prospective

did not know it, but he was celebrating not my first professorship but my last
driving lesson in Uganda in 1965 — before I left to go on sabbatical leave in
the U.S.A. , never to resume driving lessons for the rest of my stay at

complete was the decision at last to resurrect <u>Transition</u> magazine,
under the dazzling editorial troika of Wole Soyinka, Henry Gates and Kwame
Anthony Appiah. As many of you know, the magazine was started in Uganda by Raj
at Neogy at about the time of Uganda <sup>I </sup>s independence in the early
1960s. <u>Transition</u> rapidly developed into the most scintillating and
successful intellectual magazine in post—colonial Africa. When the editor was
detained by President A. Milton Obote and then stripped of his Ugandan
citizenship, <u>Transition</u> was briefly in limbo. Obote tried to persuade me
to run the magazine — but I refused to do so while its owner and editor was in
detention.</p>

started the rnagazine again. He later handed <u>Transition</u> over to Wole

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:18.7pt;margin-bottom:
8.65pt;margin-left:2.85pt'>It was great news in 1990 to learn that Gates,
Appiah and Soyinka were reviving the magazine after a lapse of some 15 years or
so. I was flattered to be invited to resume regular contributions of articles
to the magazine. I have agreed to do so — provided that one of my first
articles in <u>Transition</u> is allowed to be a vigorous rebuttal of Wole
Soyinka 's attack on my television series, <u>The Africans : A Triple Heritage</u>.
Soyinka had accused me of being an apologist for Islamic fanaticism. He has
also accused the TV series of being contemptuous of African indigenous culture.
Both charges are so palpably false that I would like to answer Wole soyinka in
his own magazine. vigorous debate was the spirit of the old <u>Transition</u>
at its best, when it was based in Kampala. It would be appropriaté for Wole and
I to thrash out our differences in the new <u>Transition</u>. (The new <u>Transition</u>
is partly based at Duke University in North Carolina, USA. )</p>

expansion of my Muslim constituency. I received more and more invitations to be
the keynote speaker at Islamic conferences. I have now received an invitation
to a conference on the Gulf crisis to be held in Teheran, Iran. Exiles from
Kashrnir have also been educating me about the problem of Kashmir in the hope
that I would begin to speak up against Indian repression there. On the other

University the year before attacking, on one side, <u>The Satanic Verses</u>,
and disagreeing, on the other side, with capital punishment itself for any
offence in the 20th century. My qualifications for the Peace Delegation to
Teheran hinged on this apparent contradiction. Unfortunately both Teheran and
Rushdie were rather intransigent in the earlier part of 1990. Rushdie became
much more conciliatory by December 1990. Unfortunately for him, the authorities
in Teheran remained uncompromising. The Ayatollahs retorted &quot;What is done
cannot be undone by saying I am sorry' ! The Ayatollahs insisted that &quot;To
forgive is divine&quot; — only God could forgive Rushdie (after Rushdie's
death) ! But if &quot;to forgive is divine&quot; , isn't &quot;to err still
human&quot;? Perhaps the Ayatollahs should reconsider their judgement.</p>

enough of a magnet? Was Africa not compelling enough as a fund raising cause?
Was it because the organization was inefficient in advertising the dinner? Or
was it because the organization was ill—advised in separating Ali Mazrui 's
lecture (given earlier in the day for only $5 admission) from the Ali Mazrui

larger than life already even as long ago as that. Afterall some of his ideas
had featured prominently in my graduate training at Columbia University in New
York a few years previously, and later in my doctoral work at Oxford University
in England. He was already an outstanding Africanist and political scientist.

in 1964 there was an element of hero-worship in my response. His book, Nigeria:

Coleman was torn between belief in individuals and belief in social forces. His

about university-development tended to zoom on potentially creative personalities.</span></p>

states was not really made by emperors, kings and presidents. It was made by
social and political processes with a deep ancestry of their own. On the other
hand, Coleman was inclined to believe that the history of great schools was
made by great headmasters and great teachers. Distinguished universities were
the product of gifted scholars and inspired academic administrators. Coleman's
micro-theories of the nation were basically democratic; his microtheories of
education were basically elitist. When he joined the Rockefeller Foundation his
ideas about what he called &quot;centers of excellence&quot; were predicated on
existing talent and outstanding individuals in educational institutions.</span></p>

dialectic of Coleman's worldview — the tension between institutions as products
of social forces and institutions as products of gifted individuals. Partly
through the Rockefeller Foundation and partly through scholarship, Coleman was
interested in helping newly independent Africa construct viable institutions
which would be relevant for what he thought of as &quot;political
development.&quot; Should Coleman continue to study the basic social forces in
Africa — and then participate in responding with relevant institution? Or
should Coleman seek to identify potentially creative personalities — and serve
Africa through them? As an academic himself, he was tempted to accord
universities a special role as institutions — whether or not that was the real
message spelt out by the wider social forces. And once he focussed on
universities the personality bias of his micro-theories tended to gain the
upper hand.</span></p>

the power of social forces turned out to have something in common with Jim

intellectual. Both of them tended to distrust &quot;exceptional

tended to have a soft spot for &quot;outstanding personalities&quot; in
scholarship. The stage was set for a conspiracy which helped to transform my

College in Kampala. The year was indeed 1964 — not long after my encounter with
Jim Coleman at Ibadan. Leys came straight to the point. He wanted me to succeed
him as professor of political science at Makerere as rapidly as possible,
preferably in 1965. He was a professor conspiring to end his own career. I was
supposed to be the means for its termination. Jim Coleman could help for a

Coleman was already a major presence on the campus of Makerere University.
After a few months I inherited the Chair of Political Sciehce from Jim Coleman
and assumed also the Deanship of Social Sciences at Makerere. The Leys—Coleman
Kingmaking seemed to have succeeded at a remarkable speed. But was it destined
to vindicate their apparent faith in &quot;exceptional individuals&quot; in
defiance of their own theories about the potency of wider social forces?</span></p>

store for Coleman's dilemma was that it was at the macro-level of the state
that a single individual at the top appeared to make considerable difference —
while at the micro-level of the University the wider social forces held an
institution captive. Coleman's theories, as we have noted, had put the emphasis
in the reverse direction exceptional individuals making a difference in
building a University but being relatively marginal in state-building or
political development.</span></p>

tried to serve (Uganda, Kenya and Zaire) told that same story in their own
different ways. But here we shall focus on Uganda. Uganda had of course
produced Idi Amin, a single individual who turned out to be adept at
demolishing one major institution after another. Uganda remains one of the most
striking illustrations of the proposition that in Africa it makes a difference
how &quot;bad&quot; the top man is. Idi Amin was indeed an &quot;exceptional
individual&quot; and not entirely in the negative sense either. He fascinated
millions of people all over the world because of his rustic charisma and his
skills in acting out Shakespeare's proposition that &quot;all the world's a
stage.&quot; He brought theatre and humour to international politics.</span></p>

hand, Idi Amin was indeed a product of the social interplay of Uganda's
history. On the other hand, almost single-handedly Idi Amin seemed to unleash
new social forces which were to bedevil the politics of Uganda for years to
come. Uganda under Idi Amin experienced both tyranny (centralised violence</span></p>

the grass roots). Tyranny is too much government; anarchy is too little.
Thousands of people died both because of orchestrated brutalities by those in
authority and because neighbour was turning against neighbour as the wider
moral order of the society was collapsing. A single individual at the top - Idi
Amin Dada — had apparently served as the decisive initial &quot;germ&quot; for
the moral and social decay of a whole society.</span></p>
