align=left hspace=12>Then comes the other side of destiny - not ancestors but
descendants, not forebears but one's own children. Let me begin with this other
side of destiny. My father was 58 years old when he died in 1947; I was 58
years old when my fourth son was born in January 1992. Was this a miracle of
reincarnation from the previous generation to the next? That is one puzzle of
the inter-generational equation, one mystery in the Mazrui <u>karma</u>. We
shall return to my latest son later. He has been my supreme delight of 1992.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.3pt;margin-bottom:
12.25pt;margin-left:-.05pt;text-indent:36.7pt'>Just about the time when Alex
Haley died in 1992, I was planning my own quest for <u>roots</u> — but almost
in reverse. I had no doubts about my <u>African</u> roots . They were deep,
familiar and truly internalized. It was the <u>Omani</u> side of my ancestry
which was in danger of being lost in the mists of antiquity. Although I had
visited other parts of the Arab world many times, I kept on missing the one
part of the Arab world which had produced some of my forebears .    In 1992
this long gap was at last filled. I visited Mazrui villages, not my usual
villages along the Kenya Coast but in the Sultanate of Oman. Many goats and
lambs were killed in lavish hospitality in honour of the arrival of the <u>African
Mazrui</u> (Some of my Omani hosts thought of me as an <u>African-American
Mazrui    </u>which was also &quot;cool&quot; ! ) . We shall return to those
issues of ancestry later also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.3pt;margin-bottom:
23.55pt;margin-left:-.05pt;text-indent:36.7pt'>Three other themes converged in
my agenda in 1992 - prodemocracy movements in Africa, Christopher Columbus as
&quot;the Black Man 's Burden, and Francis Fukuyama's thesis about &quot;the
end of history. &quot; According to Fukuyama in his seminal essay entitled,
&quot;The End of History&quot; published in the summer of 1989, all historical
change in human history was not leading to socialism and a classless society -
as Marx had predicted. Historical change had been leading towards capitalism
and liberal democracy, The purpose of history was not the final destruction of
capitalism. It was the final <u>democratization</u> of capitalism - how to make
capitalism the most productive system in human ingenuity, and yet accountable
enough and humane enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.7pt;margin-bottom:11.65pt;
margin-left:6.45pt'>In 1992 1 was invited by the news magazine <u>Africa Events</u>
in London to reflect on &quot;The Culture of Assassination. &quot; Although my
article for the magazine was primarily about Africa, the assignment made me
reflect on my close encounters with victims of assassinations more widely. I
did meet Malcolm X in New York in 1961 did he know that an assassin's bullet
awaited him? I met Martin Luther King Jr. in the same year .  I discussed with
Dr. King another great Black political figure at the time — Tom Mboya of Kenya.
Only the gods knew that both King and Mboya were destined for assassination.</p>

align=left hspace=12>In 1990 1 was invited by Raj iv Gandhi to a special
meeting in India in February 1991 to examine the special problems of the 21st
century, bringing together what the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust regarded as
some of the finest minds of the 20th century. I accepted the invitation,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.7pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:6.45pt'>Subsequently Raj iv Gandhi wrote to me to say that, because
of the war in the Arabian/ Persian Gulf, the conference in New Delhi had been
postponed until November 1991 . But before we could reconvene in November, Raj
iv Gandhi himself ( a former prime minister of India) was the victim of a
special kind of assassination.   In the West they talk about &quot;the kiss of
death. &quot; In India since Raj iv Gandhi 's death they talk about the &quot;<u>garland
of gunpowder</u>. &quot; There was a bomb in the flowers surrounding the
woman—assassin. The bomb killed her as well as Raj iv Gandhi. Did he belong to
the same gallery of martyrs as Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. , and Tom
Mboya — martyrs to social justice?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.7pt;margin-bottom:11.65pt;
margin-left:6.45pt;text-indent:.5pt'>Personally, I do believe Raj iv Gandhi did
so belong. As Prime Minister he would probably have prevented the destruction
of the mosque at Ayodhya and saved hundreds of Indian lives . But Raj iv needed
more time to mature as a politician. He was cut short.</p>

I did also hear by mail from one of the rebel military officers who had tried
to overthrow Babangida in April 1990. My correspondent is widely regarded as
having been the brain behind the attempted coup (the &quot; Godfather&quot; ) .
The officer had once been my graduate student at the University of Jos, in
Nigeria. I liked him very much, and I was quite astonished when he was
implicated in the attempted coup in 1990 . But Nigerians have a record of letting
bygones be bygones . I do hope that my former student at Jos (now in exile)
buries the hatchet with his former Commander-in-Chief , President Babangida .
They are both Nigerians of considerable talent, who should address their skills
to the problems of their country in the remaining years of the twentieth
century .</p>

Africanists, Boutros—Ghali and I had known each other since the 1960s. And when

than anybody since Dag Hammarskjöld. I am in agreement with him about most

He may also be wrong on Iraq.</p>

Universities East and West. &quot; This brought in Africa, India, Islam and

follow-up conference in China itself in 1994 . It is a real possibility.</p>

1992 I argued publicly that religious parties like the Islamic Party of Kenya
had a right to exist in a pluralistic society provided those parties accepted
the rules of the democratic process. Since the Kenya Government had refused to
register the I PK as a legitimate party, my statement in defense of democratic
religious parties made me an instant hero of supporters of I PK. I was due to
give a public lecture in Mombasa a few days later on the wider theme of
relations between Africa and the Arab world, Public interest in my forthcoming
lecture rapidly escalated — not only from mouth to mouth but also from mosque
to mosque. Hundreds if not thousands of people were expected to turn up for it.
The Kenya government panicked. They banned my lecture. For the second year in

lecture was given earlier in 1992 at the University of Michigan on the theme
&quot;Apartheid is Dying, but Zionism Persists &quot; The thesis was that both
Zionism and apartheid had been ideologies of macro— segregation creating a
Jewish state separate from Arabs, and a white state separate from Blacks . The
separatist ambition of white South Africans is in the process of collapsing.
The separatist ambition of Jews to maintain a distinct &quot;homeland&quot;
from Palestinians is still powerful. Both forms of <sup>I</sup>' macro—
segregation&quot; have inevitably entailed a degree of what is now called <sup>I</sup>'
ethnic cleansing&quot; — sometimes taking the form of outright collective
deportation of groups or population transfers . (When I gave the lecture in
Michigan I had no idea that the Israeli government would be deporting more than
400 Palestinians before the end of the year in defiance of international law
and world opinion) .</p>

at the 1992 annual meetings of the African Studies Association of the United
States. A &quot; conference within a conference&quot; was organized. The
mini-conference consisted of four panels (about fifteen papers) on the works of
Ali A. Mazrui! The event was an enormous tribute in anticipation of my 60th
birthday in February 1993 . However, the papers were not intended to be
praise-songs .</p>

align=left hspace=12>Those who did participate in the mini-conference on Mazrui
at the A.S.A. annual meetings came from diverse disciplines literature,
history, philosophy, banking, law, televisionproduction, classics, sociology as
well as political science. The most explosive issue was on gender. Did Ali
Mazrui as a <u>man </u>have a right to discuss <u>women</u> in his academic
work? This was the <u>sub—text</u> of one of the critiques. My reply was based
on two principles . First, I regarded the empowerment of women as fundamental
to the survival of the human species, as I had indicated as far back as <u>The
African Condition</u> (1979) and <u>A World Federation of Cultures</u> (1976) .
Secondly I do regard the study of Africa as incomplete without the study of
African women. In any case, if the empowerment of women is relevant to the very
survival of the human species, the issue is too important to be entrusted to
only one gender. It can certainly <u>not</u> be entrusted to men on their own.
We all have a stake in human survival. so I reiterated emphatically in that heated
exchange in Seattle between me and the distinguished West African feminist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.7pt;margin-bottom:12.8pt;
margin-left:6.45pt'>After the exchange a number of other women came to lend
support to my spirited defense. A number of them agreed with me that the
struggle for the empowerment of women did require an alliance between genuinely
progressive men and women. On the other hand, one distinguished Ghanaian
feminist was very frosty towards me after the gender session.    She seemed
more offended than was the Nigerian feminist with whom I had directly clashed.</p>

number to him. Before long my bank account was $50,000 richer.  It was an

woman and in sympathy with her distinguished family. I remembered my

mixing genes with Omanis. After all, there were Africans who were Islamized

(Maryam) Uti, the mother! ! If I had once made such a threat to my previous
sons about making a grandchild, the baby's arrival has been a supreme pleasure!

was born on the 14th of a particular month. So was Jamal, his eldest brother
and my first born. So was Albert Schweitzer, after whom my professorship is
named. So was Brenda Kiberu, an important background factor in our previous
lives. And Molly, my first wife and mother of my first three sons was born on <u>the
15th</u>. Will numerology meet with <u>karma</u> and affect young Farid' s
fortunes ? Indeed, Far id Mazrui and Albert Schweitzer were both born on
January 14th. So was Schweitzer's daughter, Rhena. <img width=1 height=1

followed with the same mission. They arrived with their little boy, Will. It
was wonderful having all of them here at Binghamton. Kim and Kay had once
offered to bring up Far id for us as his additional parents (not alternative
parents) , This kind of offer is not uncommon between relatives in Swahili
culture, but it is almost unknown in mainstream American culture. (Western
parenting generally tends to be monopolistic. A child is normally allowed only
one set of parents. Not so in Swahili culture where my brother could offer to
rear my child without my renouncing my own parenthood. )</p>

him up herself (with my help) ! Nevertheless, Pauline and I were deeply moved
by the offer from Kay and Kim.</p>

by my family in Mombasa, Kenya . But the purpose there would have been to
ensure that Far id grew up as a real Swahili-speaking person, steeped in

child ourselves even at the risk of producing another Westerner.</p>

Thanksgiving holiday in November . He was accompanied by his lady—friend,
Bonnie O ' Day. During their stay in Binghamton they beat us to Spike Lee's
film <u>Malcolm X</u>, which they both enjoyed enormously. How do blind people
like Jamal and Bonnie &quot; see&quot; a film? I asked that question, They
answered that, after the first few minutes, two skills come into play -
sensitivity to the logic of the plot and heightened sensitivity to voice and
sound,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.15pt;margin-bottom:

the Honourable Elijah Muhammad spoke with such a strong foreign accent . I was
surprised to hear that, since I knew that Elijah Muhammad was born in Georgia,
U.S.A. . I transmitted Jamal ' s question to one of Elijah Muhammad's own
children - my colleague Akbar Muhammad, a professor of history at Binghamton .
Professor Akbar Muhammad was impressed by Jamal 's sensitivity. Akbar explained
that his father's accent was regionally mixed rather than foreign. Spike Lee
exaggerated the unusual features of the accent in the film, <u>Malcolm X</u>.</p>
