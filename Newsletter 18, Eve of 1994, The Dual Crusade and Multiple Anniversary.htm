year when my youngest son was born. My wife, Pauline Ejimah Maryam ( a triple
heritage of names) gave us a another son in August 1993. Once again I witnessed
the birth in the delivery room, and I was very proud of the mother's courage
and endurance. Was I privileged to cut the umbilical cord, as I had done at
Farid' s birth on January 14, 1992? Alas, Harith Ekenechukwu Mazrui was born at
a different hospital in 1993 from that of his brother' s birth. The rules were
different. In the new hospital the Dad could watch but not directly participate
in the delivery! Well, Dads can't have everything all the time! !</p>

those and other exciting anniversaries of 1993. But this newsletter is also
about an entirely different theme   a kind of dual crusade that I waged in
1993, partly on behalf of scholarship and partly on behalf of Africa. Let us
examine the dimensions of the dual crusade first before we return to the phenomena
of multiple anniversaries .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.35pt;margin-bottom:
11.0pt;margin-left:3.8pt;text-indent:36.2pt;line-height:92%'>When William
Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge published their <u>Lyrical Ballads</u>
in 1798, it was partly in the conviction that there were times when a poet had
to create the very taste by which he or she was to be enjoyed. An innovative
poet may have to create the aesthetic constituency for his or her own
innovations . The <u>Lyrical Ballads</u> were a turning point in English
literature. Wordsworth and Coleridge were creating not just a new art-form but
new art-lovers in their audience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.35pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:3.8pt;text-indent:36.2pt;line-height:92%'>But how is this
related to my <u>dual crusade</u> of 1993? Well, during the year I found myself
engaged in <u>two activities</u> in the scholarly and activist world in which
new constituencies needed to be created. We needed to create &quot;
art-lovers&quot; for the most unlikely &quot; art-forms'    We needed to create
believers in the cause of <u>Black reparations</u>. And we needed to create a
wider constituency for a field of study which we call <u>global cultural
studies</u> . In both cases the intellectual level of receptivity was initially
at least as cautious and skeptical as that which initially greeted the <u>Lyrical
Ballads</u> .</p>

text-indent:37.2pt;line-height:93%'>Even among Black people there is
considerable doubt about whether reparations from the West for Black
enslavement and colonization is a realistic goal. And global cultural studies
suffers from a convergence of similar skeptics . There are on one side those
who believe in global ism but do not believe in cultural studies, and on the
other those who believe in cultural studies but do not accept a global level of
culture. The globalists include Marxists, Western strategists and scholars
within the world system paradigm. They do not take cultural studies seriously.
The students of culture are pre—eminently anthropologists and art specialists o
They tend to be highly skeptical of the globalization of culture. And yet here
is Ali Mazrui trying to launch into orbit an Institute of Global Cultural
Studies. Was such an institute even more of a contradiction than the concept of
<u>Lyrical Ballads</u>? My dual crusade for reparations and global cultural
studies was up against many skeptics .</p>

text-indent:37.2pt;line-height:93%'>I raised the issue of Black reparations in
contexts marked by their very diversity. I spoke on the subject as a
guestspeaker of the Zimbabwe branch of the African Association of Political
Science (AAPS) in Harare in February 1993. There were other speakers on my
panel, but the occasion was the first time I had spoken under AAPS auspices
since the Association and I broke ranks in the 1970s in a cloud of political
misunderstanding. In a sense, my reparations lecture in Harare was the final
act of reconciliation between the Association and myself e The reconciliation
was graciously aided by our Zimbabwean brothers !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:

Jamaica.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:18.5pt;margin-bottom:

University of Cape Town in South Africa.    Inevitably the question arose:
&quot;What would constitute reparations for apartheid? &quot;     The first
task was of course to genuinely end apartheid, not merely by giving Africans
the vote, but also by giving them a commensurate share of the land and wealth
of the nation. Ending electoral apartheid is much easier than ending economic
apartheid.</p>

text-indent:0in;line-height:93%'>Africa and all over the Black world — vice—presidents,
ministers, ambassadors, Pan—African activists, scholars, artists, labour union
leaders and, perhaps least expected, a white member of the British House of
Lords and a Black member of the British House of Commons , How are reparations
to be calculated? Who was liable? Who were to be the beneficiaries? What was
the case for reparations? These were some of the basic issues thrashed out
before the conference issued its historic <u>Abu ia Declaration on Reparations</u>
at the end of April 1993. The Secretary-General of the OAU, Sal im Ahmed Salim,
and Chief Moshood K, O. Abiola were major leaders of the conference. However,
the active chairmanship on a day-to-day basis was conducted by Ambassador
Dudley Thompson, the distinguished jurist from Jamaica who once helped defend
Jomo Kenyatta during the British colonial period in Kenya .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
10.35pt;margin-left:1.9pt'>I also attempted to inject the issue of reparations
in many of my public lectures in North America. My least successful attempt was
at Yale University in New Haven when I was on a panel with three other people,
including my compatriot Ngugi wa Thiong' o. For some reason the Chairperson
took a dislike either of me as a person or of what I represented.   She
intervened to make fun of my arguments in situations where I could not answer
back .    I am still licking my Yale wounds .     I hope one day somebody at
Yale would arrange a one-on-one debate strictly between my former chairperson
and myself ! I would like to see if she would be as triumphant in the argument
if she did not have the advantage of being chair! There is only one way to find
out, In Kenya I succeeded in generating a national debate on reparations, when
the paper I presented at the Abuja Pan—African conference was published in the <u>Sunday
Nation</u> (Nairobi) . It triggered off a debate in Kenya newspapers generally
both in English and Kiswahili. Perhaps the most contentious issue was whether
the Arab slave trade should be put on the same level as the trans-Atlantic
slave trade.     I took the position that although the Arab slave trade and
indigenous African slavery were much <u>older</u> than the trans-Atlantic
variety, the Arab and indigenous forms of servitude were of a <u>smaller</u>
scale and allowed for much greater social mobility - from slave to Sultan, from
peasant to paramount-chief .    Indeed, both Egypt and Muslim India had
actually experienced the phenomenon of slave dynasties .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
11.35pt;margin-left:1.9pt'>One day Arabs and Africans will perhaps have to negotiate
appropriate reparations for the Arab slave trade. But those reparations are
bound to be of a different scale and based on different criteria from those of
the Trans-Atlantic variety, with all its linkages with an expanding world
capitalist economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:1.9pt'>In the Kenya Press I debated reparations with a
variety of adversaries . But none of the exchanges was more uncomfortable for
me than the one with my old friend and colleague, Professor Bethwell Alan Ogot,
perhaps Kenya' s most distinguished historian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
9.1pt;margin-left:1.9pt;text-indent:.25pt'>Although elsewhere in his writings
Dr, Ogot had argued that Africans were making too much of the issue of slavery,
in the debate in the <u>Sunday Nation</u> Dr. Ogot seemed to have decided that
Africans were not making enough of the <u>Arab</u> slave trade. The verbal exchanges
in the Press were sometimes heated and acrimonious<img width=3 height=3

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:1.9pt'>The other part of my dual crusade for 1993 was being a
participant observer in global cultural studies .   If experts of global ism
were seldom interested in culture, and experts on culture were skeptical about
globalization, we need to bridge the gulf . Our Institute of Global Cultural
Studies at Binghamton University has been very active in that particular
mission through publications, scholarly translations, and our annual conference
on &quot;Ancient, Medieval and Modern Thought :</p>

evolving global culture.  In some respects that was symbolized by my role on a
ship called the S.S. Universe. The ship was a floating university involved in
what was officially called <sup>t</sup>' Semester at Sea&quot; . The University
of Pittsburgh organized, sponsored and gave credit for courses given aboard a
ship which literally sailed around the world in about 100 days . The American
undergraduates on board came from different campuses in the United States . 1
served as an interport lecturer between Cape Town and Mombasa    a sailing
period of about a week.</p>

text-indent:37.2pt;line-height:93%'>I must say that this was no holiday cruise.
In teaching terms, it was a busier week than any I have ever spent in the
United States . Basically I lectured in other people's classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
11.65pt;margin-left:1.9pt;text-indent:.7pt'>The range included courses on
&quot;Revolution &quot; , &quot; Comparative Slavery&quot; , &quot;Race and
Ethnicity&quot; , &quot;Political Development&quot; and special lectures when I
addressed the whole student body on board the S.S. Universe.     Since there
was no single hall large enough to accommodate everybody, some students had to
watch me on TV monitors in separate cabins ,  I did find occasion to inject the
issue of &quot;Reparations&quot; in one of those plenary ship-wide lectures .
The issue of reparations generated considerable discussion on board S.S.
Universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
12.7pt;margin-left:1.9pt'>I used the opportunities of my one week with &quot;
Semester-atSea&quot; to promote global cultural perspectives among students who
were in any case particularly eager to learn about other societies and
cultures. The ship finally entered my own hometown of Mombasa .  I was entering
Mombasa from <u>the sea</u> for the first time in decades.    I parted company
with my students in Mombasa . They disembarked to sample Kenya for about one
week, before they set sail first for a port in India, and then further east,
before returning to the United States via Seattle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.0pt;margin-bottom:
10.65pt;margin-left:1.9pt'>Another symbolically global event in my year was the
conference in New Delhi sponsored by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust . The
invitation had come from Mrs 0 Sonia Gandhi (Raj iv Gandhi 's widow) , who is
chair of the Indira Gandhi Trust. The theme of the conference was also perennial
- &quot;REDEFINING THE GLOBAL SOCIETY&quot; . The most senior participant from
the United States was Robert S. McNamara, former U.S. Secretary of Defense and
former President of the World Bank. Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of
State, was expected but did not make it. The most senior African at the
conference was former President of Zambia, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda .    It was also
wonderful to catch up with the former Secretary—General of the Commonwealth,
Sir Shridath Ramphal . I was privileged to chair the first session of the
conference.</p>

Elena Bonner, widow of Andrey D . Sakharov. Quite unexpectedly she called upon
the conference not to idolize or idealize Mikhail Corbachev in any published
proceedings .  She argued that the great majority of Russians had been outraged
when Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel prize for peace. And none of the thirteen
parties then campaigning for parliamentary elections in December 1993 in Russia
regarded Gorbachev as a hero.     She suggested that it was an insult to the
Russian people to lionize a Russian leader (Gorbachev) who was regarded as
basically a blot on Russian history.</p>

process</u>, and whether we had just started our journey back towards a world
without the state, without racism, and with diminishing separation between
church and state and rising re-tribalization. It was wonderful to see such old
Indian friends as Raj ni Kothari, Ash is Nandy, and Danish Mohan, with members

Islam globally and the Islamic revolution in Iran where at great risk.</p>

spoke in English and my remarks were translated into Farsi (Persian) . When I finished

religious .     1 was there during the first ten days of the Muslim month of
Muharram, when Shiite Muslims throughout the world celebrate the martyrdom of
Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad' s grandson.   Iran is the center of Shia
Islam. The ceremonies to mark the killing of Hussein included anguished
lamentations, ritual masochism, repeated recital of the sad story about the
brutal slaying of Imam Hussein, special prayers in mosques and homes, candle-lit
processions in the streets, rhythmic beating of the chest by men, and a lot of
generosity towards the poor. Quite often I was in a mosque long after midnight,
surrounded by literally hundreds of other worshippers. Although I am not myself
a Shia Muslim, I was deeply moved by some of those unique ceremonies . I
acquired new insights into the diversity of the Muslim experience.</p>

in 1974. The fifth was the particularly famous one of 1945 which included Jomo
Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and W. E. B. DuBois, who were at the time virtually
unknown internationally. The Kampala conference was going to be not only the
7th historically - but the first after the Cold War. Almost literally at the

helping to raise money for Makerere in a special fund-raising effort in
Manitoba, Canada, in the autumn of 1993. Manitoba had a Special Friends of
Makerere Committee which invited me as keynote speaker.     I was impressed not
only by how many Ugandans there were in the area, but also by how many
Canadians were prepared to pay for a 50 dollar a plate dinner in honour of an
African university.</p>
