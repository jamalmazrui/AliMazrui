Ohio State University has pAaye4 host to <u>me</u> in other ways over the years when
I have been a . visiting professor, or given an ad hoc lecture or participated
in a conference. A central bridge between me and The Ohio State University has
been Professor Isaac Mowoe, a genuine believer in &quot;knowledge across
cultures &quot; . He has consistently sought to tap my expertise in pursuit of
that goal . He and I have become close and mutually respectful friends as a
result. We hope that a historic partnership in the service of scholarship has
been forged.  <img width=1 height=1 id="Picture 7823"

Ope additional thought. Although my Rushdie lecture was given before I became
Senior Scholar at Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell, the Rushdie
lecture was sponsored by the Africana Center, and chaired by the Center.   In
both my capacities at Cornell (A.D. White Professor-at-Large and as Senior

and supporters. Bless them all .</p>

changes in computer technology and their effect on the needs of the blind. As
some of you know, Jamal - my oldest son is blind, and is at the same time very
much involved with computers both personally and in his work at the Kennedy
School of Government, Harvard University, Carnbridge, Massachusetts. Jamal has
argued forcefully, both privately and in print, that while previous computer
advances had been blind-user- friendly, some of the most recent computer
changes were (from the point of view of the blind) socially retrograde e They
were widening the gap between the needs of the sighted and the needs of the
blind. The &quot;Windows &quot; model <img width=1 height=1 id="Picture 65543"
