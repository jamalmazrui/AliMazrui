Louis Farrakhan, the author of the concept of the Million Man March, gave his
speech at the March, he took numerology even further. He found meaning in the
precise height of the Washington monument (the obelisk which the marchers were
looking at) . He found significance in the precise dimensions of the Jefferson
and Lincoln monuments. Nun-ber 19 particularly fascinated Farrakhan. And when I
and three other colleagues subsequently visited Minister Farrakhan in Chicago
and spent five hours with him, he elaborated further on his fascination with
nun-bers and destiny. But more about Farrakhan later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:8.45pt'>1995 was a year of anniversaries
divisible by 5 ! Binghamton University of the State University of New York
celebrated its fiftieth year of academic life. A number of events marked the
occasion, but in the shadow of gloomy news about budget-cuts and belt-tightening
as a result of the new political mood in the United States .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.9pt;
margin-bottom:10.7pt;margin-left:9.85pt;text-align:left;line-height:93%'>The
United Nations celebrated its fiftieth year, also in the shadow of budgetary
problems and a crisis of confidence arising out of its performance in Bosnia
and Rwanda . In Vienna, Austria, I took part in a special international seminar
to mark the UN' s anniversary. Both Boutros-Ghali, the present
Secretary-General , and Kurt Waldheim, a former Secretary-General attended the
Vienna Seminar . (Waldheim attended only the social events. He did not speak
even at the social events, partly because it was thought that his alleged
association with the Nazis in the past would have disrupted this 1995
international occasion) .</p>

margin-bottom:10.7pt;margin-left:9.85pt;text-align:left;line-height:93%'>Vienna
was only the first of the <u>five</u> cities in which I personally took part in
celebrating the UN's 50th anniversary . In 1945 the UN had been launched in San
Francisco. In 1995 the celebrations in San Francisco were the most central . I
attended some of the San Francisco events, and presented a paper at a
conference sponsored by the World Federalists .</p>

Outlived Its Purpose?&quot; The thrust of the argument was that the UN had
found additional purposes since it was formed, some of which were more
efficiently fulfilled than was the world body's original peace-keeping role .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:25.45pt'>Of all my five personal
celebrations of the UN, my lecture at the Fletcher School was, relatively
speaking, the most quiet and least dramatic . It was just an ordinary campus
event .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:11.05pt'>The biggest celebration of the
UN's 50th anniversary in the Southern hemisphere took place in Melbourne,
Australia, sponsored by La Trobe University and other Australian institutions .
It was a major international event, launched by Australia's Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans, who is widely discussed as a potential future Secretary-General
of the UN. I was privileged to be cokeynote speaker alongside Evans at the
opening ceremony, though the whole event became almost inaudible on one
occasion because of very loud students' demonstrations against Evans for his
policy towards Indonesia in relation to East Timor . ( Indonesia annexed East
Timor in 1976 and has denied the people of that territory self-determination.
Australia was regarded as being insufficiently critical of Indonesia) . At any
rate Melbourne was my fourth UN city of 1995. In Australia I was also reunited
with my old colleagues of the World Order Models Project .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:12.0pt'>There were some anniversaries in
my own personal life also in 1995. The year marked the 30th anniversary since I
was catapulted from lecturer to a full professor at Ivhkerere University in
1965 a crazy speed of promotion which l'Äcerere had never done before me, and
has never been repeated since . 1 have never been sure whether to be hurnbled
or shocked that I have never been Senior Lecturer, or Reader, or Associate
Professor or without tenure !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:12.25pt;margin-bottom:
11.55pt;margin-left:10.3pt'>In 1995 the African Studies Association of the
United States and the Nat inal University of Lesotho independently helped me
celebrate my thirtieth year of full professorship by voting me Distinguished
Africanist for a lifetime of service to African Studies. The Lesotho University
honoured me with a Distinguished Service Award as part of their own <u>50th</u>
anniversary, and I was given the U.S. Distinguished Africanist Award at the U.S
. Association' s annual meeting in Orlando, Florida .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.35pt'>In my acceptance speech in
Orlando, I dedicated that moment to Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Nigerian writer and
human rights activist who was at the time on death-row. Within a week Ken
Saro-Wiwa was executed by the regime of General Sani Abacha, in defiance of much
of world opinion. I had just arrived in Oxford, England, when my wife, Pauline,
phoned me to let me know about Saro-Wiwa s execution. I staggered out into the
Oxford streets looking for newspapers. All the British papers carried banner
headlines about the Saro-Wiwa tragedy. I read the accounts both avidly and in
pain.</p>

was I doing in Oxford? I had been invited to Oxford to give the annual Evan
Luard lecture by the Oxford United Nations Association. In 1995 the lecture was
to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations . I was also a guest of the
Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. The combined sponsorship of my Oxford visit
required my giving a lecture which was of relevance to both the UN and to
Islamicists . So I lectured on '<sup>I </sup>THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE MUSLIM

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.35pt'>Since 1986 Islamic studies have
been demanding more and more of my time and attention. There was a time when
people thought of me purely as an Africanist trained in political science .
Before the 1980s nobody thought of me as anybody who had anything significant
to say about Islam. Since then I now get invited to Islamic conferences from
Kuala Lumpur to San Francisco, from Ditchley to Khartoum, from Riyadh to
Chicago. What has brought about this semi-Islamization of my professional
agenda? <img width=1 height=1 id="Picture 12309"

I regard him as a martyr because the system is so hypocritical. The system
claims that a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. But when the system
fails to prove O.J. Simpson guilty, he is hounded in other ways . Civil cases
are lodged against him to reprove him guilty under standards looser than the
original ones. And even if he won these civil cases, I am sure he would be
hounded in other ways. What kind of just society is this?</p>

children have not been united on the O . J. Simpson issue. They range from the

if not justified. I personally found that the jury had reasonable doubt and the
verdict was therefore justified.</p>

aspiration to escape the culture of dependency. Western hegemony has led to a culture

Jane Austen's novels. Africa 's dependency has led to a culture of imitation

since 1986 has won three Nobel prizes for literature    its first Nobel
literary prizes ever . The winners were Wole Soyinka of Nigeria, Neguib Mahfuz
of Egypt, and Nadine Gordimer of South Africa. Their achievements were
influenced by the anti-colonial struggle but were not directly related to the
Cold War. On the other hand, pro-democracy movements in many African countries
have reduced inhibitions in writers and artists and these pro-democracy
movements have definitely been helped by the end of the Cold War .</p>

River Between</u> to <u>Petals of Blood</u>. A combination of anti-colonialism
and the Cold War radicalized Ngugi in a leftist direction.</p>
