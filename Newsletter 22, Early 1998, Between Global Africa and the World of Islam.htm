seventh century Arabs, while the Qur' anic verses revealed in Mecca were
intended for all time and all human kind. Even in the twentieth century blood
has been shed over such a debate (the dominant and orthodox opinion being that
every verse in the Qur' an is addressed to all people in all ages) . Our
debates in Pakistan in 1997 - though sometimes heated were more tolerant and
more civilized than the fatwa which led to the execution of Mahmoud Mohamed

font-family:"Courier New"'>Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, Raj iv' s widow, and the Indira
Gandhi Memorial Trust once again hosted us in New Delhi . It was the sixth
Indira Gandhi Memorial conference. Because 1997 was the 50th anniversary of
India' s independence, the theme for the latest Indira Gandhi conference was
&quot; Post-Colonial World : Interdependence and Identities. &quot; I was
called upon to give the keynote address at the very beginning of the
conference, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, former President of
Zambia. The most heated exchanges in my session were between myself and Robert
McNamara, former President of the World Bank and former Defense Secretary of
the United States. Although heated, the exchanges were very civilized. The
differences between us were not ideological but methodological . In explaining
the differences in economic performance between Africa and Asia, I had included
cultural variables. McNamara argued that differences in culture had no
relevance in explaining differences in economic performance. Both points of
view were argued forcefully .</span></p>
