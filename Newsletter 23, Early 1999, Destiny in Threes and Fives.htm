mother for almost a decade — and certainly not since Pauline and I got married
in 1991. This meant that Mama Alice had never seen her Mazrui grandchildren,
Farid and Harith, who were born in the United States. At last we got Mama Alice
a visa to come to the United States. It was not easy. To satisfy Uncle Sam I
had to submit my tax returns for the previous three years. What that had to do

so special about this conference that the two co-chairs were effectively
marginalized, and the organization of the conference was planned more directly
by the President herself. There were gains and losses in this approach. Many of
my ideas and sub-themes for the conference, hammered out jointly with co-chair
Godfrey Uzoigwe, were discarded by the President of the University on the
grounds that they were too academic. So were some of our ideas about who was to
be invited. President Sudarkasa wanted the conference to be more firmly
policy-oriented. But in the Nigerian context, there was a risk that such an
approach would make the conference more highly politicized and even partisan.
Unfortunately that is precisely what happened. The conference sometimes
exploded into passionate pro and anti-Abacha rhetoric and even abuse.</span></p>

I choose to focus my novel on Christopher Okigbo? Partly because I came from a

writing poetry. When two of my children went blind in the late 1970s, I
received poems of sympathy from friends and relatives in Kenya. It remains part
of Kenya's Coastal Swahili culture to mark great experiences with poetry. This
had nothing to do with Thomas Jefferson.</span></p>

had decided to deal with my own depression in the late 1960s with the therapy
of writing a novel about a poet. Without realizing it at the time, I was
manifesting Swahili ways of dealing with personal anguish. By writing a novel
about a poet I was taking the Swahili cultural trait one stage further than its
usual domain.</span></p>
