<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:4.5pt;
margin-left:6.25pt'>Even by my standards the concluding year of the twentieth
century generated an exceptionally wide range of debates in my life. Was the
difference in economic performance between Caribbean Africans and Caribbean
Indians due to the difference between the consequences of slavery and the
consequences of indentured labour? Was Africa still divided between coup-prone
countries and coup-proof ones? Is homosexuality more dangerous than corruption
in African societies? What is the nature of the gender-debate within Islam? Are
African languages impediments for Africa's development - or are the languages
the missing engine for development? Finally, were Africans mere collaborators
in the trans-Atlantic slave trade - or were they the main enslavers of each
other?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:6.0pt'>But 1999 had another paradoxical sub-theme in my life. On
the one hand, I touched base with Royalty; and on the other, I engaged in the
most heated debates on slavery in years. Royalty is a tradition of hereditary
privilege; slavery is often a condition of hereditary servitude. In 1999 I
found myself involved in both Royalty and assessment of slavery at different
times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:41.8pt;text-indent:0in'>Here is my last year of the twentieth

<h2 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.45pt;margin-bottom:9.4pt;margin-left:
5.05pt'>I. Taking My Bride Home to Mombasa</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:15.15pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>Let us begin with the truly personal meaning of 1999 for
the family - the most important events of the year for me. My Nigerian wife,
Pauline (her other names are Maryam Ejimah) got her United States' green card
(permanent residence) and was therefore able at long last to travel outside the
United States. Since she and our two little boys had never been introduced to
my family in Kenya, our first destination was my hometown of Mombasa. What a
spectacular reception Maryam received from the women in my neighbourhood in
Mombasa and all our friends!! One of the parties was held on a secluded beach -
with tremendous Swahili cuisine, music and dancing. Our Islamic culture kept
men at bay, while women sang and danced in private abandon!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:15.8pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>Throughout the trip Pauline did me proud. She related to my
people exceptionally well, and was soon in joking and laughing relationships
with most of the women of her own age. I saluted her adaptability! She also
looked radiant and beautiful. Of course, all my relatives called her Maryam
rather than Pauline!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>Pauline (Maryam) and I also took the children (Farid and
Harith) on tourist expeditions including a safari where we sighted three lions,
a couple of cheetahs, a dozen giraffes, a hyena, many zebras, up to a hundred
elephants, and a variety of other fellow creatures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.05pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>Our stay in Nairobi was much briefer than in
Mombasa. But there too our relatives rose to the occasion and went beyond the
call of duty to make Maryam and the kids feel welcome. Our deepest gratitude to
all our family in Kenya. Huda Mazrui was the superb coordinator, bless her! The
children of my three sisters (Salma, Nafisa and Aisha) were kept busy. My
fourth sister, Alya, was the only one who was younger than me. So she herself
was kept busy over our visit. Her daughter was away studying in the United States.
As for my elder brother Harith, he entertained us with his wit, good humour and
wise anecdotes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>The only part of the Kenya visit which was a nightmare was
my last two hours. I lost my wallet, including my documents for returning to
the United States. We discovered the loss at the Nairobi airport just before
checking in. We searched the car in which I had arrived at the airport, sent
somebody back to the Norfolk hotel in Nairobi, made a number of phone calls -
in vain! Very painfully I decided to remain behind in Nairobi while sending
Pauline and the children back to the United States. The kids were bewildered
and upset that I was remaining behind, but there seemed to be no alternative!
(Farid was seven years old and Harith was six.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:11.0pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>After Pauline and the children had left to board the plane,
my Nairobi relatives and I decided to search the car one last time!! The whole
incident had happened at night, and my wallet was completely black. But this
time, 10 and behold, we did at last find the wallet, lodged underneath one of
the seats in a very dark corner! !</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>We rushed back to the airport. The airline class on which
my family was originally booked was now full. I got a seat in another class
just a few minutes before the plane took off. Pauline and the kids had no idea
I was on board until long after we were airborne. I went looking for them, and
we found each other at last, <u>Alhamdu li Llah</u> (the Lord be praised)!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>My first public debate in East Africa in 1999 was not,
however, in Kenya. It was in Uganda, another beloved country of mine. I had
been invited by a project which was cosponsored by the Ugandan Parliament, the
United States Agency for International Development and the State University of
New York. The project was designed to strengthen the effectiveness of the
Ugandan parliament. I was invited to be keynote speaker for a workshop on that
theme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.3pt;margin-bottom:.45pt;
margin-left:3.1pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:
36.5pt;line-height:103%'>In my presentation I did distinguish between African
countries which were coup-prone (like Uganda, Sudan and Nigeria) and African
countries which were relatively coup-proof (like Zambia, South Africa, Senegal
and Tanzania). I argued that in coup-prone countries a multiparty-system
carried the risk of triggering off a military coup. This was widely interpreted
as a defense of the &quot;no-party state&quot; which was pref&amp;red by the
government of Yoweri Museveni.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt;text-indent:0in'>My remarks unleashed a debate in Uganda
which continued för weeks after I had left the country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>In reality I was simply pointing out the risks of
multi-partyism in a coup-prone country, without prescribing whether or not the
risks were worth taking. It was still open to a thoroughgoing democrat to
insist that multi-party democracy was what Uganda needed even if it carried
risks. The African subject could insist on full democratic citizenship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.85pt;margin-bottom:
14.05pt;margin-left:3.1pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in;line-height:103%'>Unbelievably, 1999 gave me a second
opportunity to visit Uganda and to start a controversy on a dramatically
different subject. For this second visit I was the guest of the Faculty of Law,
Makerere University in Uganda, co-sponsored by the Ford Foundation. The
conference in Uganda was on &quot;Constitutionalism in Africa&quot;. My own
topic was on &quot;Cultural Engineering and Constitutional Change&quot;. The
most controversial part of my lecture was on whether African governments should
pay more attention to fighting economic corruption than to fighting
homosexuality. My paper came against the background of recent gay-bashing
speeches by the presidents of Uganda and Kenya, and in the context of earlier
denunciations of homosexuality by the president of Zimbabwe. These Presidents
had acted like arbitrary sovereigns!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.55pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>While Africa could learn a lot from the West about <u>freedom</u>,
Africa had more to teach the West about <u>family</u>. Africa should learn to
understand its gay sons and daughters, not in the name of <u>freedom</u>, but
in the name of family. Homosexuals too are           The real threats to the
African family are uncritical imitations of the West, heterosexual promiscuity,
rapid urbanisation, and heterosexually transmitted diseases, including HIV! The
issue was debated in the Uganda press for weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:14.9pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>During my stay in Uganda I was stopped once or twice by
members of the small Black    <img width=2 height=1 id="Picture 10369"
src="Newsletter%2024,%20Early%202000,%20Clouds%20of%20Controversy,%20Rays%20of%20Royalty_files/image004.jpg">homosexual
minority (I am assuming it is small). I did not know them, but they knew me
from press coverage. They wanted to thank me for speaking up publicly about
their rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>But my two visits to Uganda were not all about big public
issues. The visits were also about meeting old friends and visiting old
familiar places. Dr. Suleiman Kiggundu was a student at Makerere University
when I was there as a professor and Dean of Social Sciences in the 1960s.
Suleiman later came to the United States for graduate work. Today Suleiman is
one of Uganda's leading economists and was for a while Governor of its Central
Bank. Every time I have been to Uganda, Suleiman Kiggundu has been one of my
pillars of support, although his own standing with the Uganda government of the
day has, of course, fluctuated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.1pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>Another former Makerere student was Akiiki Mujaju. While
Suleiman Kiggundu has always been a gracious fan of mine, Akiiki Mujaju was
profoundly ambivalent about me. He once even wrote to UNESCO to denounce me!!
And yet in 1998, when I visited Makerere under other auspices, and he occupied
my old office as Head of the Department of Political Science, Akiiki Mujaju was
gracious and charrning. We sat together in my old office and talked like old
friends. Of course, neither of us realized that barely a year later Akiiki
Mujaju (at least ten years my junior) would be dead in a road crash in Uganda.
I was shocked and bewildered when I learnt about his sudden death. But upon
reflection I was glad that at least in 1998, in my old office at Makerere in
Uganda, Akiiki and I parted as friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.85pt;margin-bottom:
14.05pt;margin-left:3.1pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:103%'>What is Uganda to me? Africa often allows a man to be
polygamous! When it comes to countries, I have been married to <u>five</u> -
Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, the United Kingdom and the United States. Those are the
five countries in which I have actually lived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:39.4pt;text-indent:0in'>But how does marriage to countries relate
to man-iage to women? Autobiographically, I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.05pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt;text-indent:0in'>have been married to women from <u>TWO</u>
of the countries in which I had lived. I was once married to a woman from the
United Kingdom, and I am now married to a Nigerian. My English wife, Molly
(Muna), gave me three great sons. My Nigerian wife, Pauline (Maryam), has given
two equally great sons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.85pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>Between those two marriages there was a third
special relationship to Uganda. Whenever I go to Uganda I try to meet Nalongo
(mother of twins), who nearly became my own mama once upon a time. Two
daughters of hers had been very close to me in Michigan in the 1980s,
in-between my two man•iages. One daughter subsequently got married to another
man. The other daughter tragically died at the tender age of twenty-three. But
Nalongo and I have continued to have a special relationship as friends. In jest
she says she still wishes I had become her son-in-law!! We laugh about it! Of
course, I am now happily married to somebody else. So is her eldest daughter!
But Nalongo and I tease each other lovingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:2.15pt'>The other sub-theme of my 1999 is between Royalty and
servitude. When I was in Uganda arrangements were made for me to meet with
Kabaka (King) Mutebi Il of Buganda. It was a special year for him. He
graciously invited me to his wedding in August. But the date         <img
width=2 height=1 id="Picture 13912"
src="Newsletter%2024,%20Early%202000,%20Clouds%20of%20Controversy,%20Rays%20of%20Royalty_files/image005.jpg">coincided
with the beginning of the academic year at Binghamton University, and I
therefore begged to be excused. As it turned out, I really missed out on a
spectacular event. The wedding in Kampala was a glittering and dazzling
success. My loss! After all, how often does one get invited to a Royal
extravaganza? The Kabaka's subjects relished the event to the full!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.45pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>Let us now turn to a different Royal house. Did you
know that Queen Elizabeth Il of England first became queen on Kenyan soil? This
was because she was in Kenya when her father, George VI, died in February 1952.
&quot;The King is dead; long live the Queen!&quot; She became queen immediately
although the formal coronation took place the following year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.3pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>Well, this particular Kenyan, Ali Mazrui, did not
meet Her Majesty until 1999!! I was in London as a guest of the London School
of Economics. There was no plan to introduce me to the Queen. It just so
happened that she was paying an official visit to London House, where I was
accommodated during my visit. Queen Elizabeth and I exchanged a few words of
greetings. We referred to Kenya, where I was born and where her reign began! In
a more official capacity I had met her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, much earlier

margin-left:2.15pt'>Military rule is not royalty, though it often behaves as if
it were. Military rule came to an end in Nigeria in 1999 after Olesegun
Obasanjo was elected president. Paradoxically, Obasanjo was himself a former
general and indeed a former military ruler — the first such ruler in Africa to
step down voluntarily from power. He relinquished military power in 1979 to the
democratically elected government of al-Haji Shehu Shagari. Twenty years later
it was General Obasanjo's turn to become democratically elected and receive the
reins of power from another military ruler, General Abdulsalami Abubakar.</p>

Obasanjo workshop in the moming of May 25 <sup>th</sup>. And then I had to be
in Scotland, to give a keynote address at the University of Edinburgh on May
26, 1999. I made it for the lecture in Nigeria (May 25<sup>th</sup>) and the
lecture for my Scottish friends in Edinburgh (May 26<sup>th</sup>) by the skin
of my teeth. It was a privilege to have played a part, however academic, in
launching this new phase of Nigeria's democracy. Julius Nyerere and I were
addressing newly elected members of parliament and senate, and the prospective

resisted so hard the pomp and ceremony of royalty or quasi-royalty. He resisted
what has been called &quot;the monarchical tendency in African political
culture&quot;. He tried so hard to discourage a personality-cult around him,
lived relatively modestly, tried to impose a Leadership Code of abstinence on
all his colleagues, discouraged the cult of portraits of him everywhere (not
very successfully), explicitly condemned the concept of &quot;life-presidency&quot;,
and stepped down voluntarily from power at the height of his authority in 1985.
This was one African president who explicitly declined to become &quot;Sultan

crown three times. &quot;Was that</p>

is the theme of servitude. In 1999 1 got involved in at least two debates
concerning servitude and slavery. One debate was in the Caribbean and was
sparked off by two lectures I gave in Trinidad and Tobago. The other debate was
mainly in the United States and was sparked off by Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Skip</p>

Central Bank of the country, which sponsors an annual lecture named after Eric
Williams (1911-1981), the founder Prime Minister of the country. My topic for
the Bank was &quot;The Dual Society on the Eve of the New Millennium: From
Rwanda and Cyprus to Trinidad and Tobago&quot;. (The lecture was sometimes
advertised by the Bank under a modified title.) The lecture was attended by

15.05pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>Trinidad itself was a dual-diaspora country,
consisting of Afro-Trinidadians and IndoTrinidadians. In my lecture I suggested
that one of the reasons why Afro-Trinidadians had performed worse in the
economy than Indians was because the damage of enslavement (to which Blacks had
been subjected) was more devastating than the damage of indenture labour (to
which Indo-Trinidadians had been subjected). This proposition was debated in
the country's mass media for weeks long after I had left the country. Friends
sent me clippings of the debate, parts of it extremely rude to me!!
Indo-Trinidadians were particularly offended by my proposition because it
seemed to deny them well-deserved credit for their economic achievements. I
certainly did not intend to minimize the importance of their achievements. I
was simply comparing the consequences of two historic evils (indentured labour <u>versus</u>
outright enslavement).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.5pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>My next big debate about servitude was triggered
off by Skip Gates' television series later in the year in the United States. <u>Wonders
of the African World</u> went to great lengths to portray Africans as
slave-dealers selling each other. The TV series had next to no discussion about
the role of the white man in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. I wrote what
turned out to be the first major critique of the TV series, and e-mailed it to
some twenty friends. But the Internet as a system then took over. My critique was
disseminated beyond my wildest intentions. I got hundreds of e-mails in
response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:17.0pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel Laureate, reacted
in a less than intelligent manner. While admitting that he had not seen the
series, he attacked me for criticizing it! Talk of trying to kill the messenger
without even bothering to read the message! How could Soyinka know I was not
justified in attacking Gates' television series if Soyinka had not even seen
the series?</p>

text-indent:36.7pt;line-height:103%'>Of course Soyinka might have thought that
by attacking Gates' series, I was trying to protect an income from my own TV
series, <u>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</u>. Somebody should tell Wole that
I receive not a single penny from either the BBC or PBS for either the
television series or the videos which continue to be sold. For better or for
worse, the BBC convinced me in the 1980s that since the BBC was a non-profit
organization, I could best serve the cause of future television programmes on
Africa if I was only paid when we were filming and not paid future royalties. I
have therefore not been paid by either the BBC or PBS for <u>The Africans</u>
since the end of 1986.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:12.45pt;margin-bottom:
13.85pt;margin-left:2.15pt'>It follows therefore that Skip Gates' television
series is not a threat to me personally in the least. It is a threat to wider
societal concerns. If enough African Americans were to believe that the main
cause of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade was Africans selling each other, this
could <img width=2 height=1 id="Picture 23920"

the fact that he has been the most prolific writer of them all!! Or was it
because he was so prolific? Or perhaps Ali Mazrui was being left out because he
wrote overwhelmingly in a <u>European </u>language? However, I was assured that
language was not the reason. What then was the reason?</p>

&quot;Islam and Democracy: Natural Allies or Strange Bedfellows?&quot; which I
presented under joint auspices of the Center for the Study of Islam and

presentation I distinguished between aspects of Islam which were
&quot;democracy-friendly&quot; (such as <u>shura</u> or the principle of
consultative governance) and aspects which were
&quot;democracychallenging&quot; (such as the status of women in Muslim
culture). I also discussed Muslim monarchies and whether or not they were
undergoing democratisation.</p>

LATER&quot;. Although I am not even remotely a specialist on that period of
Islamic history, I was cast in the role of one of the keynote speakers to open
the conference. I was flattered by the request, but made my presentation brief.
My Institute of Global Cultural Studies co-sponsored the conference, but the

Institute of Global Cultural Studies co-sponsored at Binghamton in 1999 — our
annual October conference, coordinated by Parviz Morewedge and the Department
of Philosophy. But a much bigger theme than Islan-l at this October conference
was ancient Greece. The whole Binghamton campus was celebrating Greece in the
autumn of 1999. The atmosphere took me back to the early days of my academic
career when I was made a full professor at Makerere University in Uganda (which
was then part of a region-wide federal University of East Africa, with a campus
each in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as in Uganda). Newly appointed professors
were expected to give an Inaugural lecture. I chose to speak in 1967 on the
following topic: Ancient Greece in African Political Thought.</p>

African experience.</p>

Foundation, the U.S. Institute for Peace and Binghamton University. In reality
the Bellagio conference was about peacekeeping, peacebuilding and
demilitarization in Africa. My Associate Director, Ricardo Laremont, managed to
assemble a remarkable combination of scholars, soldiers and diplomats to
explore the vexed question of peacekeeping and prospects for development in
Africa. The war in Kosovo was still going on in June 1999 at another level, and
provided moral and political contrasts to our debates about Rwanda and other
African conflict-situations. The Bellagio conference will yield a book based on
the stimulating papers presented there on a theme which, more than thirty years
earlier, I had called <u>&quot;Pax Africana&quot;</u> in another book published
in 1967.</p>

meeting of the African Heritage Studies Association at Cornell, Dr. Boubacar
N'Diaye from Mauritania called for a condemnation of alleged slavery in Sudan
and in his home country. Although I was the keynote speaker at that banquet
session, I did not take part in the discussions on slavery. How was the
Sudanese civil war affected?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.85pt;
margin-left:5.8pt'>Brother Boubacar N'Diaye subsequently wrote to me directly
to call for my public condemnation of &quot;slavery&quot; in Sudan and
Mauritania. On Mauritania there was little disagreement between Brother

Mauritania which deserved to be condemned.</p>

his impact on the twentieth century seemed more modest. Among 20<sup>th </sup>century

Mazrui family in Kenya and the United States celebrated the end of Ramadhan on
three entirely different days for the first time in decades!! Disagreement
about the sighting of the new moon on <u>two</u> different evenings is not
unusual. But disagreement covering <u>three</u> evenings was a truly Y2K

second son, Al 'Amin, and his wife Jill celebrated their first wedding
anniversary (December 26) romantically in a secluded holiday resort on the West
Coast. In 1999 Jill completed all the requirements for her Masters degree in
English and Multicultural Education at California State University. She may
become Vice-Principal of a middle school in the course of the year 2000.</p>

Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, but he seems to have
put that on the back-burner. Al 'Amin has been moderately active as an
entrepreneur on-line and active recruiting for Macy's, the major chain store.
He and Jill seem to be truly happy, which is of course the main thing. They
also seem to be working hard in areas which interest them.</p>

when he is fast asleep. They are very disconcerting.</p>

conceivably even a whole book on <u>ALI MAZRUI AND THE GENDER QUESTION</u>.

&quot;EXCELLENT&quot; and gave it an A grade! I did not change the grade before
returning the paper to the student, but I did add a few comments in defence of
