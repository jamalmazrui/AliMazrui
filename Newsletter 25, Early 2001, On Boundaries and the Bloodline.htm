the year when their aunt Caroline, my wife's sister, died within a couple of
months of our departure from Nigeria. Caroline was only 40 years old.</p>

These were issues of the bloodline at the level of family. We shall return to
them later. But the new millennium was also a period of the bloodline in the
sense of clan, tribe and race. In Zimbabwe I had occasion to dialogue with
president Robert Mugabe about issues of race, citizenship and rights. In Libya
I conversed with Muammar Quddafr about the competitive demands of
Pan-Africanism and Pan-Arabism. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, we explored the issue
of reparations for the enslavement of Africans across the centuries. And in the
United States I grappled with issues of race, religion and social tensions.
These subjects are part of the agenda of this years' Annual Mazrui</p>

first learnt about the death of my oldest sister, Salma. I was attending a
meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies. One
instinct was to catch the next plane out to Mombasa, Kenya, where my sister had
died. But there were two inhibitions. One was the voice of my sister's father
(who was of course also my own). Sheikh Al' Amin Mazrui (who died in 1947) had
a fatwa which disapproved of abandoning major obligations &quot;in the service
of grief.&quot;</p>

First and foremost, I heeded the advice of Salma's father (and mine) not to
abandon major obligations in the service of grief. I completed my work at
Oxford, and then went to London to give a lecture at the Ibn Rushd Centre at
Westminster University on the subject of &quot;Globalization and the Future of
Islamic Civilization.&quot; I then flew to Libya to give two lectures under the
auspices of the African Centre for Applied Research and Training in Social
Development. My Libyan topics were on (a) Pax Africana and Conflict Management
and (b) Globalization and the African Renaissance. My main host was Dr. Ahmed
Fituri, whose PhD was from the University of Michigan where I once taught. We
had known each other from our Michigan days.</p>

For thousands of dollars, I had to return to London before I could proceed to
Nairobi, and then onwards to Mombasa (can you imagine?) I was of course much
too late for Salma's funeral but in plenty of time for mutual family
consolation, for love and healing. Salma's younger son, Alamin M. Mazrui, flew
in from the United States (he is a professor at the Ohio State University). He
was not in time for the funeral either. In his case, perhaps it was just as
well. He was particularly devastated by his mother's death, and might have been
overwhelmed at her funeral.</p>

What about the borders between the newly departed and the newly born? As we
were mourning Salma's departure, one of her granddaughters gave birth to a girl
 who was promptly named <u>Salma</u>! And my own second son, Al' Amin and his
wife Jill, gave me a grandson  and they promptly called him Ali! I now know
that there will be another Ali Al' Amin Mazrui long after this old Ali Al' Amin
Mazmi is truly gone! May the next Ali A. Mazrui have the strengths of the old
one and be spared the weaknesses. Amen! Pauline, my wife, managed to be in
California on the night of the birth of our grandson, Ali. I then joined them
to admire and salute the next incarnation of the dynasty, Insha Allah! We had a
good time together in Castro Valley, California.</p>

the age of forty. I woke up one morning in Binghamton to find Pauline in tears.
Between sobs she explained to me what had happened  a sudden death, seemingly
due to an asthma attack. Caroline left behind a widower and four children. Had
Pauline not just arrived back from Nigeria herself, the temptation to fly home
would have been great for her. But a second trip to Nigeria so soon would have
disoriented our own small children (seven and eight years old)  whether
Pauline left them behind with me and Goretti or took them with her to Nigeria.

Caroline's children spent many hours playing together. The shock was that much
greater when we learnt of Caroline's death a few weeks after our departure. A
special mass organized by Goretti Mugambwa for Caroline was held at St. Paul's

However, the tragedy should not diminish the prior happiness. Pauline and our
children were enthusiastically received by Caroline and her husband and by
other members of the Nigerian family. Pauline's mother was already a familiar

between the non-tenured and the tenured professors. Kim Forde-Mazrui, my third
son, continued earnestly with his career as Associate Professor of law at the

confirmation), law professors in the U.S.A. do not have to publish as much as
professors in Political Science (in terms of quantity), but Kim has definitely
embarked on an active publishing career. This has stood him in good stead in
his tenure review. The tenure sub-committee has recommended him for tenure
unanimously (9 to 0). The family is of course cheering him on! We are naturally
optimistic that he will soon be confirmed by his Law School as a tenured

bloodline. After all, my own father (his grand-Dad) was the Islamic Chief

For a boundary back into colonial history, I have been trying to persuade my
elder brother, Harith A. Mazrui, to write his memoirs. His memories of Kenya's
colonial period would be particularly fascinating. Harith was a civil servant
within the British colonial order, and rose quite high at the Kenya Coast. What
he remembers about Provincial and District Commissioners during the colonial
period, and about Liwalis, Mudirs and Kadhis (Coastal titles) could enrich our
knowledge. Harith must hurry up before he gets too tired to put pen to paper or
even to dictate for an hour at a time. He is a whole decade older than me. I
have yet to convince him that memoirs are important.</p>

One measurement of the consolidation of the written tradition in Africa is
indeed the emergence of writers in the same family across more than one
generation. The Busias in Ghana have been developing into a literary dynasty in

What did Lynne Cheney have against <u>The Africans: A Triple Heritage?</u> She
described it as 'pro-Qaddafy and anti American.&quot; In reality the TV series
devoted only about three minutes to Qaddafy in nine hours of television! But
that was enough to arouse the ire of the Cheneys' in 1986! Mrs. Cheney demanded
the removal of the name of the National Endowment for the Humanities from the
credits, although the Endowment had contributed some $600,000 to the making of <u>The
Africans.</u> She stopped short of demanding the money back, which would have
plunged the Endowment into an acrimonious and professionally damaging law suit.</p>

proposal was whether we should add negative pictures to the sequence about Qaddaö<sup>r

In my dinner conversation with the Libyan leader I referred to my
trans-boundary concept of &quot;AFRABIA&quot;, which was an attempt to come to
grips with the implications of the fact that Africa itself was an Afro-Arab
continent  with the O.A.U. consisting of both Black African members and Arab
members. I am also on record in my plea that the Arabian peninsula should be
regarded as part of Africa for geological, cultural, linguistic and religious
reasons. I made that case in <u>The Africans. A Triple Heritage</u> (both the
book and the television series).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.05pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:36.5pt'>In a trans-boundary ambition, I
suggested to the Libyan leader that perhaps PanAfricanism and Pan-Arabism
should be forces in alliance rather than forces in rivalry. Before the evening
was over he seemed to share that vision. We were jointly exploring boundaries
of convergence rather than boundaries of divergence. Between Arabs and Africans
the bloodline was never entirely absent.</p>

language as a different kind of boundary of communication. Muammar Qadda%/ was
convinced that every African child should be required to learn three languages
apart from the child's mother tongue. The three continent-wide languages should
be English, French and Arabic (the three languages of our dinner party). We
discussed how children in Switzerland were expected to learn German, French and
Italian  with English as the preferred foreign language. Why should not the
children of Africa learn English, French and Arabic  with their mother tongue
as the fourth language where appropriate? It could help soften the boundaries
between African states.</p>

I drew the Libyan leader' s attention to the fact that his vision had omitted
Portuguese. He felt that his linguistic vision for Africa should not impose too
many foreign languages on Africa's children. In agreement, I offered the
statistic that there were more speakers of Kiswahili, Hausa and Yoruba
separately in Africa than there were speakers of Portuguese. Perhaps
Portuguese-speakers were also outnumbered by speakers of Amharic and Igbo. At
their most expressive these were boundaries of bombast and the Muse rather than
of blood and the womb. But as a strategy of regionbuilding, and the
consolidation of Pan-Africanism, was Qaddafy justified to espouse a
continent-wide language policy even if he himself had not approximated it? Was
Qaddafr ahead of his own bureaucracy in implementation?</p>

African Minister's concerns, we also discussed Muammar Qaddafy' s shift from a
policy of exporting revolution to a policy of exporting peace. His involvement
in the Philippines at the time was in the direction of promoting peace between
the Muslim separatists and the Central Government. Quaddafr's role in the
conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone had also been in the direction of seeking
a peaceful solution to those conflagrations. Libya also tried to make its good
offices available for Ethiopia and Eritrea in their fratricidal military
confrontation. Quaddaö' in the year 2000 was consciously seeking a reputation
as peacemaker, rather than an exporter of revolution.</p>

Their relations had been deteriorating drastically between 1998 and the year
2000. Talking to sub-Saharan Africans who were working in Libya when I visited,
I was told that one cause of the tension was ironically that Qaddafy's
Pan-Africanism was too far ahead of the opinions of his own population. Many
Libyans resented the resources which Qaddafy was devoting to Black causes
seemingly at the expense of Arab causes. United Nations' sanctions on Libya
over the Lockerbie affair had hurt the living standards of ordinary Libyans.
Looking for scapegoats, they sometimes turned on the foreigners in their midst
 especially non-Arab foreigners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:15.85pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:11.5pt;text-indent:36.5pt'>And yet Qaddafy realized it was
Black Africans more than the Arab brothers who had turned against the United
Nations' sanctions over Lockerbie. For once the leader was truly more sensitive
to the fundamental forces than his population. Ordinary Libyans turned against
Black Africans while Qaddafy tried to lead a movement towards continental
African Union.</p>

Wole Soyinka and I were put on the same panel, as I have indicated earlier.
This was the nearest Wole and I had come to mutual civility. Skip Gates might

Let me now turn to issues of freedom elsewhere in Africa. When I met President
Robert Mugabe in August 2000, I reminded him of a conversation he and I had had
in the 1980's. In those earlier years of Zimbabwe's independence, white racism
was still often overt. In major restaurants in Harare it was not uncommon to
hear white customers abuse Black waiters in racist terms. I therefore had
occasion to say to President Mugabe in the 1980s' &quot;I have heard more
racist remarks in Harare in one week than I normally hear in the United States
in a year. Why do you permit it?&quot;</p>

as follows: &quot;There are two ways of improving the behaviour of people short
of using force. One way is by constructive persuasion; the other is by positive
example. In the new Zimbabwe we shall try those two methods first. '<img

changed his mind? When we met again at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair in

reform? Even if he felt force was necessary in order to redistribute
European-held land to African farmers, why had he not used the power of the

However, this one was deceased and greatly missed. I am referring to the memory
of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, the Founder-President of Tanzania, who died in
1999  just a few months short of the new millennium. Since he died I have been
called upon repeatedly to reflect on his significance for post-colonial African
history. In the United States I have lectured about Julius K. Nyerere from
Cornell New York to Columbus, Ohio. On the radio I have discussed him on the
Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation. In newspapers I have
analyzed him in the <u>Sunday Nation </u>(Nairobi), <u>Business Week</u> (Dar
es Salaam) and elsewhere.</p>

Later in the year I was in Addis Abba, Ethiopia, to discuss the issue of
reparations for Black enslavement and exploitation. Professor Jacob Ade Ajayi
of Nigeria, Arnbassador Dudley Thompson of Jamaica and myself are among members
of the Group of Eminent Persons appointed by the summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1992 to embark on a crusade for
reparations. In the year 2000 we were at the OAU headquarters to take stock and
plan the next phase of the crusade. My stay in Ethiopia was enriched by my old
friend, Abdalla Bujra, who virtually co-hosted my visit. My only regret was not
being able to get together with the OAU Secretary-General Salim</p>

affected my family also in the year 2000. Since I am also descended from a

issue was raised in some of the Internet debates among East Africans such as
the &quot;MWANANCHI&quot; Internet Circle. Was Ali Mazrui famous because of his
ancestral bloodline connections?</p>

I had to point out on the Internet that by the time I was growing up the Mazrui
family was neither politically powerful nor economically affluent. My academic
rise was on the basis of scholarships  a Kenyan government scholarship (BA), a
Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship (MA), and the Oxford University (Nuffeld)
Studentship (D Phil.). My professional rise and academic ascent had nothing to
do with family connections or my bloodline. Let us hope the rise was due in
part to hard work and serious application. It was also due to good luck, as so
often happens.</p>

Mazrui grew up in east Africa in a period when physical contacts between
regions of Africa were very limited. In fact in the early sixties even within
some of the regions of Africa, a telephone call from Lagos to Cotonou - a
distance of only 147 miles - would have to be routed through London and Paris.
Telephone calls at that time between Mombassa and West Africa were quite
unknown. journeys between east Africa and west Africa had to be routed via
Europe. That was the situation when Ali Mazrui and i were growzng up.</span></p>

prediculous. I was recently reading one of the introductory essays to the

pretend nor indeed even aspire to be literary critic of Ali Mazrui, but I would
like to say one or two things about the tremendous impact which his writings
have had on policy and opinion makers, not just in Africa but beyond. His many

testimony to the wide acknowledgement of the value of Ali</span></p>

remember how enthralled I and a good many others who listened to vour Reith
lectures of 1979 were at your discussion of the African condition at the time.
I remember well that series of six lectures. the first you discussed Africa in
its state of decav. In the second that black oeople are the most humiliated
a-nd dehumanised in the history of mankind. In the third that Africa was
stealing cultural ænsitions while experiencing the impact of Christianitv and
Western violence. In the fourth you traced the reasons for Africa's
under-development. In the fifth you identified the cleavages of ethnicity,
ideology and nationalism among the African regions. 111 the sixth lecture,
which I thought was probably the most controversial, you talked about the
marginalisation of the African cultures and the -implication of the acquisition
oz nuclear capability.</span></p>

course the hallmark of deep and visionary thinkers that they provoke
controversy, but I am sure that Ali Mazrui himself is quite used to Ihis
writings and lectares provoking some controversy<sup>r</sup>. But the eath is
that most authentic deep thinking Africans and non-Africans genuinely
interested in understanding the reality as against the perceived notions of
African affairs have always valued his contributions even when they do not
share his views.</span></p>

about Prof Ali Mazrui for the first time when I was a high school student in
Mombasa, the natal home of the learned Professor, in the late 60s. The
Professor then was almost a mythological figure in our town. He was rumoured to
be a master of.the English language who was using it to raise controversial
political issues in international journals.</span></p>

encountered his writings in. the then most sprightly, sexy, and occasionally
teasing Transition magazine, edited by the late Rajat Neogy. I distinctly
remember some of his seductive pieces that appeared then,such as Nkrumah - the
Leninist Czar, Tanzaphilia, and Phallic Symbols in Politics and War. These were
exciting times in East Africa and the University of East Africa,and especially
Makerere, was the intellectual hub of the emergent intellectual culture. Every
East African with any intellectual pretensions wanted to be in Kampala. And the
-main attraction was really Ali Mazrui. They wanted to be witness to this
relatively young Professor who was still to complete his doctorate under John
Plaminatz at Nuffield College, Oxford.</span></p>

until the month after I graduated from the University of Nairobi, that I met
Prof Ali Mazrui for the first time, in the unlikely town of Nlalindi. The
occasion was a luncheon hosted by my 'czncle for his close friends who included
Ali <sup>l </sup>s raiatively young uncle, Shaykh Abu Suleiman. Among those
present was the diminutive Chief Kadhi of Kenva, the late Sheikh Abdallah-
Saleh Farsv, who also happens to have been a student of Shavkh Alamin Bin Ali
Mazrui, the illustrious father of Professor i Mazrui.</span></p>

impressionable graduate I was awed by Ali's reputation as a scholar. Little did
it occur to me then that we were to pursue identical careers and I was to be
part of the generation that came after his. After the usual niceties, my uncle
suggested that I take Ali and show him around. The Ostrich Farm was suggested.</span></p>

in ostriches. We took the occasion to discuss our favourite issues: politics,
literature and history. Ali had a way of making younger people more relaxed by
engaging them as equals. He allowed me to disagree with his perspectives on
African and international issues.</span></p>

concerned me then also was the nature of political science as practiced by Ali
Mazrui. I had been educated to believe that no social analyses could be take
seriously without the appropriate dose of mathematical formulae and diagrams
with curves. Ali was in fact in the process of removing political analysis from
the stuffy context of University lecture halls and journals by evolving a prose
style appropriate to his needs.</span></p>

conversational and part written style of much of his already significant ouvre
was taking a distinctly Mazrui flavour. This style was to be parodied by the
American novelist and travel writer Paul Theroux in a Transition piece. I
remember then that an issue of Transition without a contribution by Ali Mazrui
was not something to look forward to.</span></p>

an extra mile to be of help to others. He has paid thousands of dollars for the
education of both African and non-African students ranging from remote villages
in Africa to American Universities.</span></p>

He also does this for purposes of mentoring young scholars who have not been

Ali Mazrui is both anxious and optimistic about the future and role of African
languages in the emergent global culture dominated by the indisputable
ascendancy of the American version of the English Language. He shares these
anxieties with other prominent African tuals like his countryman Ngugi Wa
Thiong and the Cameroonian philosophe; Paulin Hountondji, who want African lan<sup>e
</sup>guages to become viable tools of al intospection andd aÆcuIation and as

linguist T recognise that all languages are at par with one another. There are
no superior or inferior languages. Only that every epoch has its own dominant
Ian* guage; the Medieval period had Arabic and Latin as the languages of
intellectual discourse. English is the reigning champion at the moment, and
from the look of things, for a long time to come. This has very liäle to do
with the intrinsic nature of the English Language. Rather it has much to do
with its lack of linguistic chauvanism. In the words of Professor Geofrey
Leech, English is a hospitable language that has aboÉbed and continues to
absorb words from all languages. Its speakers are no longer recognisable on the
basis of their race or creed. It has been forced by historical circumstances to
embrace every conceivable racial and ethnic types who can all lay claim to it.</span></p>

not at all surprising that the best writers writing in English at material time
are actually not mother tongue speakers. This is reflected in the preponderance
of writers from the Third World who have won the Booker Prize for Literature m

parts of the world to use English as a realistic means of reaching a global
audience.</span></p>

heritage if it were not for the thriving translaEon activities that were so
much a part of that multicultural and tolerant Andalusian Muslim world that was

Ali Mazrui<sup>f</sup>s legacy is his espousal of the philosophy, of
globalisation and its potential as a paradigm for the peaceful coexistence of
Civilisations, races and religions without any one dominant group imposing its
hegemony on the ers. It is interesting that a lot of the issues that Samuel
Huntington had discussed in his well&quot; known book Clash of Civilizations
have preoccupied Ali Mazrui in the past four decades, only that they were
discussed in terms of their relationship to the African World.</span></p>
