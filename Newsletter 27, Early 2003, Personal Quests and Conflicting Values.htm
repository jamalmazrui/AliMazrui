&quot;it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot; We celebrated
during the year one hundred years of literary excellence in Africa's
experience. We marked the legacies of such twentieth century African Titans as
Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, and Nelson Mandela. My family buried some dearly
loved members and planned the weddings of others. I suffered the aches of old
age but enjoyed the privileges of being an elder. Africa, Islam and the West
continued to be my own triple heritage. We sadly said eternal farewell to some
friends.</p>

September 11 is the increased interest in Islam in the United States and
elsewhere in the Western world. There is more curiosity than ever about Islamic
thought, culture, theology and civilization. Colleges and universities are
starting new courses, and a spate of new books about Islam have been appearing.
Mind you, some of the books create more confusion about Islam than they explain
it.</p>

you some of these experiences in this twenty-seventh newsletter to my friends,
colleagues and members of my extended family. I hope you find the newsletter
entertaining as well as informaon &quot;Terrorism and War&quot; consisting of
lectures by different campus professors from different disciplines. Nearly five
hundred (500) students took the course. The most hotly debated lecture was my
own lecture on &quot;Islam between Zionism and Pax Americana.&quot; The campus
Rabbi wanted to see the videotape to check if my lecture had been anti-Semitic.
The Rabbi later came to see me in my office for a friendly exchange of views.
Though my lecture had been strongly critical of Israel, the Rabbi seemed satisfied
that my lecture had not been anti-</p>

margin-left:.7pt'>Daniel Pipes, the militant Zionist and Islamophobe who heads
the Middle East Forum, was less impressed by the distinction between
anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. He coauthored an article in the New York Post
in which he denounced me and a number of other professors as &quot;Extremists
on Campus.&quot; My colleague at Binghamton, Dr. Robert Ostergard was in
reality &quot;guilty&quot; only of having been the coordinator of the course on
&quot;Terrorism and War&quot;but Daniel Pipes denounced Ostergard also as an
&quot;anti-Zionist extremist&quot;! Guilty by asfrom Ann Arbor in Michigan to
Georgetown, Washington, D.C. Students of the targeted professors were
encouraged to spy and report on them. Although I was one of the eight targeted
professors, I would like to believe that none of my own students have been
hostile to me, or been spying on me!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.6pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

my reputation. There might have been hundreds of such bogus emails which went

reporting all this Internet harassment to the Federal Bureau of Investigation

celebrate Africa's 100 best books of the last one hundred years. Africa's Nobel
Laureates in Literature were expected to be among the winnersWole Soyinka,
Nadine Gordimer and Naguib Mahfuz. At least one book of each literary Nobel

Some statesmen make history but do not write it. But there have been people who

interpreter of history and a maker of it. In Africa, such a synthesis of
activist-author includes our own Nelson Mandela. In July 2002 we honoured
precisely that synthesis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>It was an evening to celebrate a century of Africa's literary
excellence. Of that century Nelson Mandela spent more than a quarter behind
bars. There are prisoners who become more bitter in a cage. Mandela became more
humane without losing his love for freedom. There have been prisoners in
history who compromised their principles in order to get early release. Nelson
Mandela repeatedly scorned the bribe of an early release if the cost was moral
compromise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>If by the end of the twentieth century there was one single
statesman in the world who came closest to being morally number one among
leaders of the human race, Nelson Mandela was probably such a person. Now in
the twenty first century he has become the most distinguished and scathing
critic of the American arrogance of powerthe U.S. transition from Superpower
to Super Empire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.85pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.7pt'>His love of books was enhanced rather than diminished
in prison. I personally discovered in an unusual way how Mandela had continued
to read widely even in jail. It was the occasion when we first met. Mr. Mandela
was attending his first summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity,
but before he himself was Head of State. This was in Dakar, Senegal, in 1992.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:15.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.7pt'>I met Nelson Mandela in the corridor, one to one. I
said, &quot;Mr. Mandela, my name is Mazrui.&quot; He cut me short and completed
my name, &quot;Professor Ali Mazrui?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:15.6pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.7pt'>Now why should Mr. Mandela in 1992when he had only
recently been released after twentyseven years in prisonhave heard my name at
all? After all, when he went to jail, I was a nonentity. The only explanation I
could think of was that even in prison Mandela's reading was so wide-ranging
that he had even read Ali Mazrui. I was flattered for myself, but more
important, I was impressed by Nelson Mandela as a true lover of books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.05pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:.7pt'>In Dakar Mandela impressed me in his capacity as a
reader. In Cape Town in 2002 we honoured him in his capacity as a writer.
Although he had lost a quarter of the twentieth century behind bars, Mandela
turned his bondage into a literary inspiration. His long walk to freedom was
also a long march to literary excellence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>That dazzling evening in Cape Town reminded me of something
else, relevant to Nobel-scale brilliance. U.S. President John F. Kennedy was
entertaining about one hundred Nobel Laureates of different disciplines in the
White House. Kennedy is reported to have said: &quot;This is the largest
concentration of intellectual power to have assembled in this room since Thomas
Jefferson dined herealone!&quot; That night in Cape Town, in 2002, I was
confronting a concentration of literary brilliance of similar magnitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>When in 1998 1 proposed at a Book Fair in Zimbabwe that
Africa selected Africa's own 100 greatest books of the last one hundred years,
I had no idea that the proposal would fly. After all, my many proposals to
Africa and the world over the years have had a mixed record. My most
controversial proposal in my BBC Reith Lectures in 1979 was a recommendation
that the Third World should pursue nuclear proliferation as a method of forcing
the existing nuclear powers to agree to universal nuclear disarmament. My designated
nuclear powers in Africa were post-apartheid South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria.
In the end, my recommendation had no takers in Africa</p>

dialogue between civilizations, participants debated topics such as religious
intolerance, origins of terrorism, economic imbalances between developing and
developed nations, the role of the United States as a superpower, and the
importance of women in bringing about social change. Participants also
responded to questions from the attending audience. Billed as &quot;Global Town

country; Thomas Michel, Coordinator for Inter-Religious Dialogue for the
Society of Jesus at the Vatican, and many other prominent figures representing
various nationalities such as India, Malaysia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Tibet.

I did not start speculating about my possible retirement. Life and health
permitting, should I retire when I am 75 years old in 2008? Or should I retire
when I complete my twentieth year at Binghamton University in 2009-2010? Or
should I begin to retire in installments much sooner, reluctantly giving up
Cornell University first before I step down from Binghamton University later
this decade?</p>

in Cape Town as a Keynote speaker to open a special conference to mark a
century' of literary excellence in Africa's experience. I caught up with a
number of old friends at the conference in Cape Townranging from Zeke
Mphahlele, the man of letters, to David Harrison, the BBC television producer
without whom my television series The Africans: A Triple Heritage would never
have been done. David had been both the principal fundraiser and the Executive
Director of the Africans. When we met in South Africa in July 2002 he asked me
for an interview.</p>

Mandela. Why a Kenyan's evaluation of Mandela when we were both in Mandela's
own country? Well, David Harrison was working on a television project about
Mandela, and wanted the views of prominent Africans from different countries
about Mandela.</p>

friends Nuruddin Farah, the Somali novelist, and his wife Amina Mama, the
distinguished Nigerian scholar at the University of Cape Town. It was, in terms
of conversation, a lively and most enjoyable evening. Later in the year I ran
into Amina in Washington, D.C., at the annual meeting of the African Studies
Association. Alas, it was a brief and hurried encounter. Perhaps we will meet
again when I return to South Africa in June and July 2003 for the joint
congress of the African Association of Political Science and the International
Political Science Association, God willing.</p>

civil conflicts in Africa, nuclear stalemate over North Korea, the pandemic of
AIDS, and the spectacular tragedy of the space shuttle Columbia. But the Dorset
novelist Thomas Hardy reminded us &quot;If a way to the Better there be, it
exacts a full look at the Worst.'</p>
