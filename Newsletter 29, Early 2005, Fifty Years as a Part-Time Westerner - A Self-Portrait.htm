margin-left:.7pt'>In this era of debates about globalization and clashes of
civilizations, let me devote this issue of my annual newsletter to the
personification of global relations. Although this newsletter is very personal
and subjective, it also seeks to capture wider cultural paradoxes within the
life of a single individual. I would like this newsletter to be a commemoration
of my fifty years as a part-time Westerner. It was in 1955 that I left Africa
for the first time in pursuit of further education in the Western world. I left
Mombasa, Kenya, for Nairobi by train  and then flew from Nairobi to London. It
was my first experience of traveling by air. The rest is history!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.6pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>Let me tell the story backwards. What happened in the last
twelve months which captured this personification of global forces in myself?
There was the experience of my receiving an honorary Doctorate of <u>Divinity</u>.
Such a sacred salute was neither from a Muslim institution (such as Al-Azhar)
nor from a non-Muslim institution located in the Muslim world (such as the
American University in Cairo). I was honoured specifically in <u>Divinity</u>
by Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, which was founded on Christian Presbyterian
principles. I was also invited to give a <u>sermon</u> before the graduation
ceremony. My sermon was on the following topic:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

honorary degree in divinity by a white Christian institution happened in the
official presence of the Governor of the State of</p>

Pauline  brought up as a Roman Catholic in Nigeria  was also a guest of the
college. It was a great inter-faith event which was happening in America long
after poos</p>

debates about political Islam. Concurrently with the threat of clashes of
civilizations has been the parallel force of dialogue between cultures and
religions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>Ethiopia is the oldest Christian country in the Black world.
Major parts of Ethiopia were converted to Christianity in the fourth century of
the Christian era. Under a Christian monarch in the seventh century, Ethiopia
played host to the earliest Muslim refugees on the run from persecution in
Arabia. Ethiopia's earliest Muslim refugees included Uthman bin Afan, who was
destined later in history to become the third Caliph of Islam and the
authenticator of the authorized version of the Qur' an.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:38.65pt;text-indent:0in'>In the year 2004 there was a more modest
replay of Ethiopia's ecumenical conciliation between</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt;text-indent:.5pt'>Christianity and Islam. There is now a
national university of Ethiopia called Addis Ababa University (previously named
Haile Selassie I University). Although the university has been secular since
the reign of Haile Selassie, it has, in composition, been overwhelmingly
Christian. In 2004 this national university awarded for the first time an
honorary doctorate in Humane Letters to a Muslim from outside the country. The
award was conferred upon me by the Head of State of Ethiopia, President Girma
Woldegiorgis. My acceptance speech included a verse from the Qur' an in both
Arabic and English, recited aloud before the graduation crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>In this new era of candor I was also given a platform the
next day at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies on campus to elaborate on my
views about Ethiopia in African affairs. In my lecture I argued that some
people are born Pan-African, some become Pan-African and others have
Pan-Africanism thrust upon them. I came close to suggesting that Ethiopians
belonged to the third category. Although. all my hosts were gracious and
polite, some were outraged by my remarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>But just as civilizations can move from dialogue to partial
synthesis, so can races. In 2004 my grandson, who was named after me, [Little
Ali], moved to Binghamton to live with Grandpa, with my wife Pauline, and with
my two youngest children, Farid and Harith. There was nothing unusual about a
grandchild spending a year with grandparents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>What was unusual was the racial synthesis. Little Ali looks
totally white [or Caucasian]. His Caucasian features are so striking that we
cannot risk crossing the border into Canada without the possibility of being
suspected of kidnapping a four-year-old white child! Indeed, Pauline was going
to visit my relatives in Toronto, Muhammad Yusuf and his wife Khyrul, with all
the children  and then Pauline cancelled the entire trip precisely because our
papers proving Ali was my grandson were not yet complete. Can you imagine? [In
American English &quot;Caucasian&quot; means of White European ancestry].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:216.6pt;

Al' Amin (Ali's father), was half English. And partly because Ali's mother,
Jill Mazrui, was also half Caucasian (Black Guyanese <img width=2 height=2

and Pauline? This time the reason was tragic. Ali's mother, dearest Jill, died
of cancer in the summer of 2004. She was in her early forties. It was a
devastating experience for us all. Pauline and I offered to look after the

proposal was acted upon by international publishers and others. Nominations of
great books were invited internationally, and a distinguished panel of judges
was appointed. Because the concept had originally come from me, my own books
were disqualified from the competition, but I was officially appointed as
&quot;the Founding Father&quot; of the whole process. When the awards of the
final list of Africa's greatest 100 books of the last 100 years were at last

in the short list. I heard from the Nobel Committee and Nobel Foundation in
Oslo inviting me for an evaluation of Wangari Maathai for the Prize._ I got the
impression that the decision was hanging in the balance as the final short list
was being assessed. In my response to the Nobel Prize selection judges I had
the following to say:</p>

for the Nobel Prize for Peace. It is an imaginative and worthy nomination. I
sincerely hope her nomination moves forward towards eventual success.</p>

text-indent:36.2pt;line-height:98%'>Wangari Maathai is a major activistfor
democracy and human rights. That makes her important but not unique. Wangari
Maathai is a major campaigner for women's rights and gender equality. That also
makes her important, but not unique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.55pt;margin-bottom:

defense of the environment. In Eastern Africa Wangari Maathai is almost unique
in her readiness to risk her freedom and even her life in defense offorests and
the heritage of nature. She has struggled hard to convince Kenyans that their
habitat is at risk, and they may bequeath to their children a more damaged and
less beautiful country than they found.</p>

text-indent:36.2pt;line-height:98%'>Wangari decided early that true
environmental activism requires more than preaching about ecological hazards.
It also requires implementation and positive demonstrations of what individuals
can do, either on their own or in organized partnership with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:11.65pt;
margin-left:38.4pt'>Some environmentalists limit themselves to preventive
action. Conservation is interpreted as saving the heritage already in
existence. Wangari Maathai interprets conservation to include environmental
renewal and replenishment. It is not enough to stop the reckless destruction of
trees, crucial as that imperative is. Africans must also cultivate the habit
ofplanting new trees to replace some of those we are continuously losing. It
has been estimated that Dr. Maathai and the Green Belt movement have helped women
to plant up to twenty million trees, sometimes for shade, sometimes to stem
soil erosion, and sometimes for the sheer beauty of nature.</p>

believe Africa has won about half a dozen Nobel Prizes for Peace. Four of them

Australia and New Zealand with a school group, I was alarmed! The program was
called &quot;People to People&quot; [ in their case, &quot;Little Peoplé&quot;
to &quot;Little People&quot;]. They were to spend a couple of weeks in those
two countries Down-Under, under the supervision of their American teachers and
their local hosts. I was more nervous about Farid being so far away from his
parents than his mother was. But psychologically I was reassured when my
friend, Sam Makinda (a Kenyan-Australian professor), told us about how he and
his wife could be reached in Australia in case of any emergency about Farid.

concessions were made. Harith would visit friends in Canada while Farid was
away Down-Under. And Harith would subsequently be allowed to join a school
group to Hawaii, the place where World War Il first penetrated the United

University of Nairobi. But the late Vice-Chancellor Joe Karanja at Nairobi took
me out to a private lunch at the Norforlk Hotel in Nairobi in order to explain
why he was unable to hire me. My record at Makerere as a controversial scholar

government scholarship to complete my secondary education in Great Britain. As
luck would have it, the school chosen for me by the Kenya government at the
time was the Huddersfield Technical College in the industrial north of England.
Once again I was surrounded by scientists and technologists, although I myself
was pursuing social sciences and humanities. My two years at Huddersfield
earned me five subjects at advanced level Higher Certificate of Education and
two subjects at ordinary level. The school later became the Huddersfield
Polytechnic, and has now matured into a full university with a bias for science
and technology.</p>

Manchester. The city of Manchester had once been a major engine of England's
industrial revolution in the nineteenth century. During my own undergraduate
years (1957-1960) Manchester was still a major industrial and engineering
center. Living in the shadow of industrialism and technological production was
becoming a lite motif of my academic career.</p>

intrigued by the paradox between Oxford and Cambridge in British experience.
The City of Oxford was more industrial than the City of Cambridge, but the
University of Oxford was less oriented towards science and technology than the
University of Cambridge. &quot;Oxford has had the factories of technology;
Cambridge has had the laboratories of science&quot;  so went an old adage. My

professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Here another contradiction
in my life neared its head. The State of Michigan produced more motor-cars than
any other place in the world, yet I continued to depend on the women in my life
to drive me around! This part-time Westerner did not have a driver's license,
having never taken an official drivers' test. My dependence on my first wife,
Molly, as a driver gave her extraordinary power over my movements on land but
she lost control over my movements in the skies! It was a standard joke in the

military democratization. It seeks to break the monopolies in weaponry in the
hands of the northern warlords. Nuclear proliferation also seeks to break
secret societies based on forbidden nuclear technology under the control of the
West and Soviet bloc. But ultimately the best moral case for military
democratization... is whether this democratization will in turn ultimately lead
to the drastic reduction of large scale warfare in human affairs.</p>
