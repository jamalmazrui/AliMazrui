South Africa when I was elated by even bigger news. At long last I had a
grand-daughter  my first female progeny! Until then God had indeed blessed me
with five sons and two grandsons. But I was beginning to wonder whether my immediate
line would ever produce a female descendant. And then, 10 and behold, Jamal and
Susan awarded me little Nicole. It was a gender breakthrough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:12.95pt;margin-bottom:

been chosen with great circumspection. Jamal and Susan (the parents) solicited
the votes of the rest of the family about the prefened names for their
daughter. The parents computed the order of preferences from each member of the
family. When the name <u>Nicole</u> seemed triumphant, the parents wanted to be
sure that its abbreviation [Nick] did not mean something negative in some
African language. I assured the parents that the female name &quot;Nike&quot;
[pronounced literally] was a respectable Yoniba name in Nigeria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>Nicole's second name is <u>Molly</u> to commemorate Jamal's
mother. I do hope Nicole's third name will be the African name of <u>Vele</u>,
since I had dedicated my Venda doctorate to Nicole, and since the Chancellor at
Venda had given her that South African name.</p>

is a convergence of African, Caucasian, Arab and Japanese ancestry (Susan's
mother was Japanese and father was Euro-American). Whatever happens, Nicole
should include the Venda name of <u>Vele</u> as pan of her identity in the
years ahead.</p>

my first son <u>Jamal</u>. Because Jamal's day of birth (December 14, 1963) was
so close to Kenya's attainment of independence (December 12, 1963), I agonized
over what name to give him, if Molly had no objection. I did consider calling
Jamal &quot;Jomo&quot; after the symbol of Kenya's independence (Jomo
Kenyatta). But I concluded that calling my first son &quot;Jomo&quot; would
offend my mother since she was hoping I would call the boy &quot;Al 'Amin&quot;
after my own Dad. But for Kenya's independence, I would indeed have called my
first son, &quot;Al 'Amin&quot;.</p>

another <u>Muslim</u> name, my mother would only be <u>disappointed</u> rather
than offended. However, what Muslim name sounded closest to &quot;Jomo&quot;?
You have guessed it! Molly and I agreed on &quot;<u>Jamal</u>&quot;! I decided
that it was also a bonus that &quot;Jamal&quot; echoed the first name of my
Egyptian hero at the time, Gamal [with a G] Abdul Nasser, the President of
Egypt! I suppose I could have called &quot;Jamal&quot; <u>JUMA</u> (a Swahili
name). Unfortunately, that would have implied he was born on a Friday.</p>

politicized issue, please remember the euphoria of Kenya's independence. I was
located across the border in Kampala. Yet I could not go to Nairobi for the
event of the century because my wife was on the verge of giving birth to my
first child. I thought I could combine the two momentous celebrations (Jamal's
birth and Kenya's independence) by looking for a suitable name for my first son
to mark the occasion. The two events were &quot;<u>beautifu</u>l&quot;! This
was additional justification for the choice of &quot;Jamal&quot; (which is
Arabic for &quot;beauty&quot; in both the male and the female).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.35pt;margin-bottom:

in a single name was the beginning of my future concept of &quot;AFRABIA&quot;

Uganda invited me in 2006 to go to Kampala and be Keynote Speaker at the
Celebration of their 40<sup>th </sup>Anniversary as Uganda's Central Bank, I
was excited for more than one reason. Makerere University joined the Bank in

Makerere was about to award an honorary doctorate to the Head of State, Milton

Kenyan was not an issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

Social Sciences? I served as Dean for two years, and was running for a second
term when three Ugandan colleagues (one in economics and two in my own
Department of Political Science) led the anti-Mazrui pack for the Deanship.
When I realized the strength of emotions, I withdrew from the Deanship race. I
did not want to be caught up in a debate about &quot;who was preventing
Ugandans from being promoted.&quot;</p>

While in Kampala, I paid a condolence visit to my old colleague Senteza Kajubi.
We knew each other when he was Professor of Education at Makerere and later
when he was Dean of Education. After I left Makerere, I knew Senteza was
Vice-Chancellor of one of the private universities of post-colonial Uganda.
Indeed, his new university did me the honour of awarding me an honorary
doctorate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

margin-left:5.3pt'>When Senteza and I were both at Makerere, he served as the
Chair of the Makerere Housing Committee. In those years every member of the
academic staff was entitled to subsidized housing on campus. But the decision
of who got which house was based on a points system (size of family, rank of
the applicant, duration of service at Makerere, etc.)</p>

line-height:94%'>My wife at the time, Molly, and myself were dissatisfied with
the house we had been allocated. So every time a better house fell vacant, we
applied to the Housing Committee, and every time we were turned down. One day I
decided that enough was enough. So I approached the Chair of the Housing
Committee, Senteza Kajubi, and asked him what I could possibly do to have
enough points for a house we wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:4.8pt'>Senteza offered to give me what he described as his
&quot;twining formula&quot;. It turned out that Senteza's wife had given him
three sets of twins, one set after another. This is for real! Since my wife
Molly was giving me only one child at a time in the maternity ward, I should
learn the Kajubi formula of multiplying if I wanted a better house than the one
awarded to me! We both laughed over his recommendation. Molly had given me
three children, but only one at a time! We had failed miserably as twin-makers,
but eventually Senteza Kajubi felt sorry for us  and allocated us a much
better house.</p>

former colleague, Tony GinyeraPinyewa of Makerere fame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

waist down. He woke up one day to find he could not walk. A major tragedy, but
I was encouraged by his cheerfulness, sense of humour, and continuing
intellectual alertness. I am still not sure if his condition can be cured. The
blindness of two of my own older sons (Jamal and Kim) seems beyond cure.
Fortunately, my boys (as well as Dent Ocaya-Lakidi) are strong individuals with

few years ago a South African university invited me to receive an honorary
doctorate at the same ceremony which was also conferring such a degree on
Nelson Mandela. I was, ofcourse, impressed by the university which was
honouring me. I wasflattered by the tribute to my scholarship, the recognition
ofmy services to Africa. And Ifelt really good that I was going to be honoured
at the same ceremony as Nelson Mandela.</p>

Iwas soon disabused of thatfantasy. Nelson Mandela indicated that he would only
be able to accept the doctorate ifthe ceremony was conducted in his village in
South Africa. And so instead of the apocryphal Muhammad going to the mountain,
the mountain went to Muhammad! The university in question packed its bags,
gowns, microphones, hundreds ofchairs and dozens of tables  and packed its
buses with students, professors and administrators to go to Nelson Mandela 's
village. The ceremony was held on the grounds ofMandela 's village residence.</p>

Muhammad Ali was the great presence. That evening and the next day the boxer
and I spent many hours together.</p>

near Philadelphia 's railway station, passers-by recognized Muhammad Ali
instantly. But since Iwas standing by Ali 's side, the pedestrians assumed that
I was either Muhammad Ali 's secretary or his aging bodyguard! So those
passers-by who wanted Ali 's autograph or wanted to shake his hand first came to
mefor permission. Muhammad Ali authorized me to be the go-between!

equivalent of &quot;Group Areas Act&quot;. These are ethnically segregated areas
in the occupied territories, complete with separate roads and pathways which

comparison was between Idi Amin's Uganda in 1972 and ethnic cleansing in
Palestine in 1947-48. Idi Amin threw out of Uganda an estimated 120 thousand
South Asians in 1972. Israelis under the direct instigation of their leader Ben
Gurion, and his immediate associates, succeeded in expelling three quarters of
a million Palestinians, especially in 1948. The Israelis torched and
deliberately burnt whole Palestinian villages  creating much more terror among
these poor Arab farmers than anything to which the South Asians were subjected
by Idi Amin in 1972. When you get a chance, consult the repolts of such liberal
Jews as Noam Chomsky. On ethnic cleansing and the founding of Israel, consult

comparison with apartheid South Africa. In my 1990 book, <u>Cultural Forces in

I compared them as ideologies of territorial separation and segregation of
communities. An American publisher accepted my book, <u>Cultural Forces in
World Politics</u>, provided I dropped the Chapter on &quot;Zionism and
Apartheid&quot; and another chapter which compared the first Palestinian
Intifadah with the Chinese Youth revolt in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>

side in the Arab-Israeli conflict was disastrously enfeebled. Israel's sense of

a disproportionate sense of impunity to bully, abuse and oppress Palestinians
without risking any large-scale war. Jimmy Carter effectively neutralized Egypt
 and thereby disproportionately empowered Israel as an occupying colonialforce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>When President Mwai Kibaki appointed me Chancellor of Jomo
Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Thika and Nairobi), I had no
idea how many of my old dreams would be reawakened in me. One dream was the
establishment of a university at the Coast of Kenya and preferably in my home
town of Mombasa. I started raising the issue again with the Kenya Government
and in the public media, as a University Chancellor! Until 2006 Kenya had six
public universities  and not a single one was based at the Coast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>A related dream was the elevation of the Mombasa Polytechnic
to university status. This institution was once called the Mombasa Institute of
Muslim Education <img width=9 height=1 id="Picture 138885"
src="Newsletter%2031,%20Spring%202007,%20Comparative%20Anniversaries%20-%20Positive,%20Negative%20and%20Neutral_files/image027.jpg">providing
technical education for students from Kenya, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Uganda and
British Somaliland. All the students were at the time intended to be Muslim. On
the other hand, all the insfiuctors were Europeans, often hired directly from
Britain.</p>

</span>

<div class=WordSection11>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>The technical institute was funded by the colonial
authorities in those five East African countries, by the Colonial Office in
London, by this Highness the Aga Khan, and by local Muslim communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>When Kenya became independent the technical institution
ceased to be denominational and became totally secular for any qualified
Kenyans. It was renamed the Mombasa Polytechnic. But it still fell short of
university status. It was not until 2006 that the Kenya Government finally took
the step of turning the Mombasa Polytechnic into a degree-granting institution
in the making. To my utter delight the Mombasa Polytechnic became a constituent
part of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, of which I
continue to be Chancellor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>What has made this dream-fulfillment particularly gratifying
for me is that J was present as a junior clerk when the Mombasa Institute of
Muslim Education [MIOMEI opened for the first time ever in 1950. MIOME also
happened to be my first regular job. From junior clerk I was later promoted to
the job of boarding supervisor in charge of Halls of Residence. In 1955 1 was
awarded a Kenya government scholarship to enable me to study in Great Britain.
MIOME gave me a great send off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

myself Chancellor of a technological university of which the Mombasa
Polytechnic (formerly MIOME) is a constituent part. The Lord does indeed
operate in mysterious ways. Let us praise him.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Another long standing dream of mine from the mid- 1970s to
2002 was to be able to give public lectures in Kenya, or be interviewed by both
the electronic and print media about political issues in the country, without
interference by either the local or national authorities. I have re-acquired
these freedoms since Mwai Kibaki came to power in 2002 and created a more
transparent Kenya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>Even my television series, <u>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</u>,
(BBC/PBS), which had effectively been banned on Kenya television since it was
first broadcast in Britain, the United States, Nigeria and Zimbabwe in 1986,
was at last shown to Kenyan television audiences under the new political
dispensation of Mwai Kibaki.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>My fourth dream was in terms of family. To the credit of the
previous regime of President Daniel arap Moi, they never interfered with my
access to my family in Mombasa  inspite of the regime's political disapproval
of me. My Kenya passport was renewed routinely, often speedily. I was only very
rarely harassed when visiting Kenya <img width=8 height=1 id="Picture 142403"
src="Newsletter%2031,%20Spring%202007,%20Comparative%20Anniversaries%20-%20Positive,%20Negative%20and%20Neutral_files/image028.jpg">and
very mildly at that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>But since I had no official or professional appointment in
Kenya, my visits to the family were approximately once every other year. What
has happened since I became a University Chancellor in Kenya has been at least
two visits to Kenya every year on official business, with time to visit members
of my family in Mombasa and Nairobi, as well as being accessible to the Kenya
public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:.7pt'>A more recent dream was to help Jomo Kenyatta University of
Agriculture and Technology [JKUAT] be better known around the world. It is

I am not sure if the dogs were wild Alsatians or bull teniers. What was
obvious to us was that such dogs could not possibly have been owned by regular
Kenyan coastal people  least of all the Swahili people. Extended families with
lots of children in Africa cannot risk having ferocious dogs at home. Muslims
especially distrust dogs generally. My first wife, Molly had a hard time in
Uganda in the 1960s convincing me to accept a dog in my home. But I agreed in
