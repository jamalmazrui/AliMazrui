The following love poem was written in honor of the wedding ofJamal Mazrui and Susan Palmer on April 12, 2003.
The Difference You've Made
A village street at dawn,
A quiet misty bay -
Such solitude, such emptiness Was once my lonely way.
But the sound of your love
Has changed everything
Behold a single cloud,
An owl at break of day, And see my past in that light; As lost Iwas as they.
But the scent of your love Has changed everything.
Like the widower by the fireside,
Bereft ofhis yesterday,
Like a lonely child in the wilderness a game to play.
But the vision of your love Has changed everything
When my life stepped into yours
This gloom was cast away "One small step" in the dark "Our giant leap" into day!
The touch of your love
Has changed everything.
Yes, everything.                                                   2
