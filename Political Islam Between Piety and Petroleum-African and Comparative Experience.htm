find it easier or more difficult to stabilize democracy? Libya has of course
been an oil-rich country almost throughout its life since the fall of King
Idris in 1969. Has Libya’s oil wealth helped or hindered its prospects for
democratization? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            A positive example outside Africa is the
discovery of oil resources in the waters of Norway and Scotland. This was a
case of economic enrichment of already mature democracies. In the case of
Norway the oil has strengthened the welfare state and stabilized democratic
governance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            In the case of Scotland petroleum
initially deepened Scottish nationalism and aggravated separatist sentiment for
a while. But the longer term consequences have given Scotland a regional
legislature and more solid influence within the United Kingdom. The arrival of
economic enrichment after substantial democratization has stabilized the
democratic order in both Norway and Scotland.   With a developing country like
Libya or Algeria, on the other hand, the petro-wealth preceded stable
democratization. The countries became independent with huge economic and
political problems which made the postcolonial era inherently unsustainable for
long. The oil wealth of Nigeria posed comparable challenges. Nigeria’s
petroleum was mainly in the Eastern region. The debatable point was whether the
petro-wealth contributed to the level of self-confidence of Eastern Nigeria.
Did this trigger the Eastern-led military coup of January 1966? Did the East
seek to control more effectively the petroleum located in their own region? And
when Eastern Nigerians later became victims of the Northern counter-coup, and
the genocidal anti-Igbo massacres, did the petroleum in the East strengthen the
late Ojukwu’s resolve to attempt secession from Nigeria? Predemocratic
petro-wealth had created impediments to Nigeria’s democratic progress.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Another African example of natural wealth
before national democratization was the former Belgian Congo upon attaining
independence in 1960. Eastern Congo at the time was almost as well-endowed as
Eastern Nigeria — but the Congo had Katanga minerals rather than petroleum.
Just as oil-wealth later triggered separation and attempted secession in
Eastern Nigeria, copper and other mineral wealth inspired Moise Tshombe to
attempt the secession of Katanga from the former Belgian Congo. In the second
half of the twentieth century both Nigeria and Congo Kinshasa illustrated the
proposition that natural resources before the stabilization of democracy was
likely to militate against further democratization.      On the other hand, the
Republic of South Africa had <i>selective</i> democracy for white people a
century and a half before extending the full franchise to black people and
other South Africans of colour. Whites had free and fair elections for
themselves but not for the rest of the population. The country had a working
parliamentary system, and a judiciary which had relative independence within
the constraints of a racial political order. Even at the height of apartheid
South Africa was acquiring democratically relevant experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Did the fact that South Africa had a
racially selective democracy,<i> alongside prior mineral wealth</i>, help
post-apartheid South Africa to enhance its democratic order? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            While the Congo had seen its democracy
collapse within a year of attaining independence, and Nigeria had a military
coup in less than six years of attaining sovereign status, South Africa
continues to have the most liberal constitution in Africa’s entire history
nearly two decades after the end of apartheid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Post-apartheid South Africa had not only
extended the franchise to citizens of colour, but had also abolished the death
penalty, enhanced Press freedom, freely elected three different presidents since
1994, recognized gay rights, and legalized same-sex marriage and civil unions.
Even selective democracy, combined with simultaneous mineral wealth, provided
subsequent opportunities for further democratization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            However, all three well-endowed countries
(Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of South
Africa) had to confront a shared threat to democracy — the threat of
plutocracy. Substantial mineral and petrowealth in these three countries
created potential rivalry between rule by the wealthy and rule by the people.
Let us turn to these dilemmas more fully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Oil-rich Third World countries are
indeed caught between the reality of plutocracy (rule by the rich) and the
aspiration towards democracy (rule by the people). The wealth of petroleum
creates great disparities in income and major differences in economic power. On
the other hand, the population as a whole can become restless for a greater say
in how the wealth of the nation is distributed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In addition to the choice between
plutocracy (the power of wealth) and democracy (the power of votes) Algeria was
for awhile disrupted by militocracy (the power of soldiers and the military).
Indeed, during much of the second half of the twentieth century, Algeria was
controlled more by soldiers than by either the economically rich or by people’s
power. Nevertheless, the country’s petro-wealth created additional motivation
for the military to control the economy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Indonesia also used to be
coup-prone. Even before the twenty-first century Indonesia had become less <i>coup-prone
</i>by demonstrating how an incumbent ruling party can be outvoted and be
peacefully replaced. When such a change occurs though the ballot box more than
once (as it has in Indonesia) the prospects of becoming a <i>coup-proof </i>country
improve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In the case of Iraq and Bangladesh
this twenty first century seems to have made those two states less and less <i>coup-prone</i>
but unfortunately more and more <i>conflict-prone. </i>Nigeria has also been
repeatedly disrupted by conflict and terrorism. And the tensions between
Christians and Muslims have often exploded into violence — including terrorism
against such foreigners, as United Nations personnel.Pakistan has been both <i>coup-prone</i>
and <i>conflict-prone</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In addition to plutocracy, democracy
and militocracy, the Muslim world has been struggling with meritocracy (rule by
the learned and the skilled). The world has viewed the Ayatollahs of Iran
primarily as a religious class. What has been ignored is that the Ayatollahs
are also a learned class. Iran is both a theocracy and a meritocracy. Indeed,
the Supreme Leader of Iran is one of the three or four best educated political
leaders in the world. Of course, the education of the Iranian leadership is
Islamic rather than Western. This educated revolution in Iran can be contrasted
with the Congo which in 1960 had only a handful of college graduates in Western
terms. Unfortunately the military coup in Lagos is January 1966 interrupted the
merit-symphony in Nigeria. Southern leaders in Nigeria in 1960 were educated in
the Western tradition. Northern leaders of Nigeria in 1960 were educated in the
Islamic tradition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Ironically, the Nigerian civil war
(1967–1970) reactivated elements of meritocracy within the separatist Eastern
Region (Biafra). The Igbo had revealed technological skills in the second half
of the twentieth century. Indeed, their triumphant economic skills in Northern
Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s contributed to their vulnerability as a people
in 1966. For a while Eastern Nigeria was well-endowed in education as well as
in petroleum. The East was both skill- intensive and resource-intensive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.05pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>During the Nigerian Civil War
innovativeness among the Igbo produced black Africa’s first-locally-made
gun-vehicles. During that Biafran conflict the Igbo displayed levels of
innovation which were unprecedented in post colonial African history. The Igbo
created rough-and-ready armed militarized vehicles as well as the beginnings of
Africa’s industrial revolution. This renaissance was aborted by the oil bonanza
from 1997 onwards. </p>

Nigeria was more internally innovative than externally prosperous. The Nigerian

oil bonanza after the 1973 OPEC price escalation created <i>disincentives</i>

decision from the 1990s that he was an African first and an Arab second. He got
disenchanted with fellow Arabs — having first begun as a Pan-Arabist. His
gender policy was perhaps more African than Arab. And in his last twenty years
in office he had put his money more in Pan-African ventures than in Pan-Arabist
projects. He saw himself less and less as heir to Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt
and more and more as heir to Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. His foreign policy was
less informed by Islam than by antiimperialism. His colorful dress culture was
more reminiscent of West Africa than of the Arabian Peninsula. </p>
