history is the fact that this land is the last country on the African continent
to be <u>liberated</u>, and yet it is also among the first to be truly <u>democratized.</u> 
In our context here, liberation is either from racial minority rule or from
colonialism in the imperial sense.  On the other hand, democratization is
either the guest for, or the consolidation of a system which combines
government’s accountability, with popular participation, and links the pursuit
of social justice with the open society. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>        Almost every other African country which
attained liberation from European colonial rule in the 20<sup>th</sup> century
was unable to maintain its democratic order beyond its first decade of
independence.  Within that first decade either the military captured power, or
the elected president became a dictator, or a civil war broke out, or the
ruling party outlawed any rival political party and turned the country into a
single-party state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>        The height of the drama occurred in
Sharpeville when five thousand protesters confronted three hundred policemen in
March 1960.  These so-called security forces in Sharpeville went to the extent
of using live ammunition.  To add insult to injury, armoured vehicles and air
force jets were used to deepen the atmosphere of intimidation.  The protesters
were unarmed and had been using Gandhian methods of non-violent disobedience
and passive resistance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>        Official figures of casualties claimed that
69 were killed and 180 were seriously injured.  Unofficial calculations

iconic in the struggle against apartheid.  The killings, beatings and large
scale imprisonment of hundreds of people virtually destroyed the dream of
ending apartheid by non-violent means and passive resistance.  Both the African
National Congress and the Pan-African Congress started seriously considering
armed struggle in pursuit of a more democratic order in South Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>        And yet Sharpeville continued to be an
inspiration for collective protests elsewhere in Africa.  While Sharpeville
coincided with the liberation from colonialism of 17 other African countries in
the same year of 1960, the Soweto uprising in 1976 coincided with the 200<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the outbreak of the American war of independence in 1776.  But
while in the case of America’s independence the relevant month of celebration
was July 1776, the relevant month of celebration for the Soweto uprising was
June 1976. </p>

students exploded into the Soweto uprising on June 16, 1976, protesting the
marginalization of indigenous languages in black schools, and the imposition of
Afrikaans and English as media of instruction in most of the syllabus.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.45pt;margin-bottom:

.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>        While the American Boston Tea Party in 1776
used “<u>taxation with</u> <u>representation</u>” as a symbol of liberation,
and Sharpeville used abolition of “the pass laws”, the youth of Soweto believed
in “no choice of communication without choice of representation”. Language
policy in education was at the center of the Soweto uprising.  It was reinforced
by the support of the Black Consciousness Movement.  </p>
