# Ali Mazrui Sharable Collection

Distributed by his son, Jamal Ali Mazrui, on February 24, 2019

My father, Ali Al'Amin Mazrui, was a prolific writer and lecturer in political science for half a century until he passed in 2014.  I would like as many of his works as possible to be freely available for review, analysis, and discussion.  At present, most of his writings are copyrighted articles or books.  

As an initial contribution to the cause, I am sharing a collection of academic essays and biographical newsletters that Professor Mazrui already shared publicly with colleagues and friends via email or the web.  The essays address international topics related to culture and politics.  The newsletters , issued annually, reflect on his professional and family experiences for about thirty years of life based in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Binghamton, New York.  Each file is a PDF with a name corresponding to the title of the document.

I invite contributions to this collection by persons who have written or recorded works by my father in their possession, which may be shared without violating intellectual property rights of others.  Newsletters 15 and 16 are missing, so they would be particularly appreciated.
