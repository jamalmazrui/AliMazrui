Ali Mazrui Sharable Collection
November 8, 2015
by Jamal Mazrui

My father, Ali Al'Amin Mazrui, was a prolific writer and lecturer in political science for half a century until he passed in 2014.  I would like as many of his works as possible to be freely available for review, analysis, and discussion.  At present, most of his writings are copyrighted articles or books.  

As an initial contribution to the cause, I am sharing a collection of essays that he has already publicly shared with colleagues by email or the web.  Most of the files in this collection are essays on international topics.  A few pieces are biographical in nature.  Each file is a PDF with a name corresponding to the title of the document.

I invite contributions to this collection by persons who have written or recorded works by my father in their possession, which may be shared without violating intellectual property rights of others.
