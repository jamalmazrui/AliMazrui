how the twentieth century would have been different had he never been born.
Mazrui would have re-discovered that an African relatively illiterate
electronically reached the biggest electronic audience reached by any African
in history, and certainly in the twentieth century. Mazrui’s electronic impact
was first by his BBC Reith Lectures <i>The African Condition</i> in 1979,
second by his PBS/BBC television series <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i>
(translated into multiple languages) which first aired in 1986, and third by
his widely-publicized Internet critique of Henry Louis Gates’ television series
<i>Wonders of the African World</i> in 1999. By his electronic impact alone Ali
Mazrui was a unique African of the twentieth century. Certainly his radio and
television work reached millions of people world wide, in multiple languages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Our focus in this essay remains America-centric. In what
ways has Ali Mazrui essentially helped to redirect American higher education?
What have been Ali A. Mazrui's contributions to higher education in the United
States? These have been multifaceted. At least as significant as the content of
such contributions have been the means and instrumentalities through which
those contributions have been made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Those instrumentalities can be translated into roles which
Ali Mazrui has played. These are, firstly, Ali Mazrui as a classroom teacher on
campuses; second, Mazrui as a writer of books and scholarly articles; third,
Mazrui as a broadcaster on radio and television; fourth, Mazrui as a public
speaker who is in demand nationally from New York to Austin, Texas, and from
Boston to Berkeley, California; fifth, Mazrui as a feature-writer for
newspapers and magazines; sixth Mazrui as a leader in academic and educational
associations; and seventh, Mazrui as a consultant to bodies which range from
the World Bank to emerging colleges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> However, let us first look more closely at Ali Mazrui’s
life before the American phase if we are to understand what he brought to
America. We must also scrutinize the assets and liabilities which came with him
to the United States. </p>

<h1 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.05pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>Ancestry and Ascent </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali Mazrui came from a highly devout Islamic Swahili
family at the head of which was his father, who was for a while the Chief Kadhi
(or Chief Islamic Justice) of Kenya. In his childhood in the 1940s Ali Mazrui
accompanied his father on some of his trips across Kenya to hear appeals under
Islamic law. Ali Mazrui’s first exposure to the Akamba and Gikuyu Muslims in
the Kenya hinterland, for example, was through the judicial duties of his
father as a roving court of appeal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali Mazrui’s father died in 1947 when Ali was only
fourteen. Had the father lived, Ali would have been trained as an Islamic
jurist, culminating at Al-Azhar </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>University in Cairo. In his father’s absence, Ali applied
for scholarships and finally succeeded in winning a Kenyan Government
scholarship (colonial) to enable him to complete his secondary education in
Huddershield, England, and to enable him to do his first degree at the
University of Manchester, England. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali Mazrui’s first exposure to the Untied States was as a
graduate student at Columbia University, New York. He completed his Masters’
degree at Columbia in nine months. He used the summer to take courses at the
University of Mexico, Mexico City, and at the University of California,
Berkeley, while still under Rockefeller Foundation sponsorship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali Mazrui did his doctoral work at Oxford, University
England, funded by Nuffield College, Oxford, of which Mazrui was a student. Ali
Mazrui also did some broadcasting for the BBC radio during his Oxford years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> His first regular academic position was as a Lecturer at
Makerere University in Uganda where he subsequently became both Head of the
Department of Political Science and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences.
After General Idi Amin captured power in a military coup in January 1971,
Uganda became increasingly unstable. It was the instability and violence which
finally forced Ali Mazrui and his family to leave Uganda and move to the United
States. The option of going back to Kenya instead of coming to the United
States was not open to him because the University authorities in Kenya would
not hire him. The reasons against him were political. Mazrui was regarded as a
political dissident. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:13.05pt;

-.25pt'>Between Assets and Liabilities </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:3.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Among Ali Mazrui’s special assets which he brought to the
United States was firstly a brilliant dialectical mind—dialectical in the sense
of a capacity to discern the unity of opposites. His work is full of paradoxes;
sometimes genuine, sometimes contrived. Each of the six Reith Lectures on the
BBC World Service in 1979 was based on a paradox about “the African Condition.”<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.8pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> There is also his controversial article “Nkrumah: The
Leninist Czar” first published as an evaluation of Kwame Nkrumah when he was
overthrown in a military coup in 1966.<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt;text-align:left;line-height:199%'>            Ali
Mazrui’s second major asset was a highly developed command of the English
language. His facility of language has been relatively free of jargon, but not
entirely free of idiosyncracies and verbal conceits. He is often tempted to
play with words. It works in his oratory, but it does not always work in his
writings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The third major asset which Ali Mazrui brought with him
was his enjoyment of writing and the ease with which he could produce competent
written material at relatively short notice. He is one author who never suffers
from a writer’s block. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The fourth major asset with his arrival was his oratorical
skill. Although he prefers to have written notes before him, and sometimes even
a text, he is capable of departing entirely from his text and to deliver a
brilliant lecture almost extempore (In the American academic market his
lectures do often earn him thousands of dollars per performance). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Mazrui’s fifth asset has been his capacity to let his
three civilizations (Africanity, Islam and Westernism) illuminate each other.
One powerful illustration is his description of the birth of Islam as “the
first Protestant Revolution” within the <i>Christian</i> tradition.<sup>3</sup>
Mazrui’s second book chronologically was entitled <i>On Heroes and
Uhuru-Worship</i>, deliberately echoing Thomas Carlyle’s classic, <i>On Heroes,
Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History</i>. Mazrui has repeatedly borrowed from
English literature to point an African moral or adorn an Islamic tale.<sup>4</sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> What about the <i>liabilities</i> which Mazrui brought
into his American career? One liability has been an unresolved conflict between
his role as a political thinker (which may need no documentation or footnoting)
and his role as a social scientist (which does require greater attention to
formal evidence). Considering how impatient he has been with the minutiae of
formal footnoting, it is astonishing that Mazrui has risen as high as he has,
and published in some of the most respected journals in the Western world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But is Mazrui a man of ideas or a man of science? When the
man of ideas in him prevails, the scientist appears to lack rigour. On the
other hand, it has been the originality of many of his ideas which have made
his reputation internationally, as well as established him in the United
States. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Another unresolved conflict in Mazrui has been
between the political activist and the scholar. As far back as his Uganda days,
Ali Mazrui was asked by President Milton </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Obote “Are you sure you know the difference between being a
political scientist and being a politician?” President Obote was getting fed up
with Mazrui’s criticisms of Obote’s policies, disguised as political science!
In the United States the activism which might have cost Mazrui greater academic
honors in Ivy League circles has been his defence of the rights of Palestinians
in some of his public lectures, and even debates within his classes. In chapter
8 of his book <i>Cultural Forces in World Politics</i> he even compares the
logic of Zionism (separating Arabs from Jews) with the logic of apartheid
(separating Whites from Blacks). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt;text-align:left;line-height:199%'>            And
yet even on the question of the Jews Mazrui’s dialectical mind has been in
evidence again. In the same book Mazrui devoted a separate chapter 7 in praise
of Jewish intellectual achievements and calling upon Black people to learn from
Jewish experience. In short, Ali Mazrui has been an admirer of the Jewish
people and still been a passionate critic of the policies of the Israeli state.<sup>5</sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The third unresolved conflict in Ali Mazrui has been
whether he is a journalistic populariser or a solemn and profound scholar. This
ambivalence has made him courted by both the media and the academic world. No
African scholar in history has been heard by more radio listeners (e.g.,
Mazrui’s BBC Reith Lectures), seen by more television viewers (e.g., Mazrui’s

between being secular and being religious. Mazrui’s lifestyle in the United
States has been basically secular. He has been married twice, in each case to a
woman from a Christian family. The three sons of his first marriage (all of
them in their thirties now) have grown up as liberal, secular Americans. Their

series, <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage </i>which includes extensive
treatment of Islam in Africa. The other factor which helped to give Mazrui
instant fame among non-Africanist Muslims was his attack on Salman Rushdie’s
novel, <i>The Satanic Verses</i>. His attack was made in a public lecture given
at Cornell University in 1989 soon after the publication of Rushdie’s novel in
the United States. Muslims present at the lecture audio-recorded it. To
American Muslims the lecture was regarded as sensational. Tapes of it were
distributed far and wide. Academic America also sat up and took notice. The

sixth overlapping liability with which Ali Mazrui arrived in the United States
was in any case in belonging to a minority religion and often a suspect
community —the Muslims of America. In reality African Muslims suffered far less
in the United States for their religion than, say, Arab Muslims. African
Muslims were seen much more as Africans than as Muslims. They were more likely
to suffer for their race than for their religion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

education in the United States? Here, too, distinctions have to be made between
different areas of study. These include new perspectives on, first Africana
studies; second, conflict studies; third, cultural studies; fourth, global
studies, and fifth Islamic studies. These areas are of course overlapping. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> For example, his concept of Africa’s “triple heritage” is
a contribution to both African Studies and Islamic studies in American higher
education. By “the triple heritage” Mazrui means the convergence of African
culture, Islam and the Western Impact upon Africa. Mazrui also coined or
re-invented the term “global Africa” to signify the emerging network of
relationships among people of African descent scattered worldwide. He gave the
concept “global Africa” visibility by making it the title of program 9 in his
television series <i>“The Africans: A Triple Heritage”</i> (PBS and BBC, 1986)
“Global Africa” is also the title of a course that Mazrui teaches at Cornell
University every year. The term “Global Africa” has since also crept into the
writings of other scholars, and the concept of “Global Africana Studies” is sometimes
used in Centers of African-American and African studies.  </p>

include the historic impact of the Sultanate of Oman on Zanzibar and the East

colonialism and its aftermath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

Africans”</i> (relatively new African settlers in the Americas) to be
distinguished from <i>“African Americans”</i> (in the usual sense of survivors

developing from the 1990s has been between <i>Africans of the soil</i>
(Africans who are part of the African continent but not necessarily part of the
Black race) and <i>Africans of the blood</i> (Africans who are part of the
Black race but not necessarily part of the African continent). Most Tunisians
and Algerians are Africans of the soil but not of the blood. Most African
Americans and Black Jamaicans are Africans of the blood but not of the soil.

Black America and the Caribbean. Some of Mazrui’s former students subsequently

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> This links up with Mazrui’s work on cultural studies
(culturology) and global studies (globalogy). Ali Mazrui tends to use the word
“culture” in its sociological sense (the values and institutions of a society)
rather than in its aesthetic sense (works of beauty and creativity, like music,
paintings and poetry). When he was a professor at the University of Michigan
(1974–1989) Mazrui organized a special course of his own on what he called
“International Political Culture,” and taught it at both graduate and
undergraduate levels. The course subsequently developed into the more
comprehensive course on <i>“Cultural Forces in World Politics” </i>which has
been taught at different levels at State University of New York at Binghamton.
The course explores the impact of such forces as religion, language, ideology
and sexual division of labour not only on politics within societies but also on
relations between societies. The course has become so successful at Binghamton
University that when Mazrui is not teaching it, the department of political
science asks another professor to take it on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali Mazrui has his own paradigm of culturology. He sees
culture as serving seven or eight functions in society. In his paradigm,
culture can be our lenses of <i>perception</i>, or our source of <i>motivation</i>,
or our means of <i>communication</i>, or the basis of our <i>stratification</i>,
or our mode of <i>production</i>, or the pattern of our <i>consumption</i>, or
our standard of <i>evaluation</i>, or the very foundation of our <i>identity</i>.<sup>11</sup>
He started developing this paradigm of culture from his BBC Reith Lectures in
1979, and has been promoting and developing it ever since. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> He developed even earlier his concept of <i>counterpenetration</i>
as a separate aspect of his worldview. At a time when most Third World
intellectuals were recommending that their countries should attempt to <i>“delink”</i>
from the economies of the North, Ali Mazrui recommended the alternative
strategy of <i>counterprenetrating</i> the citadels of power and attempting to
influence the North from within. Even before the word </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>“globalization” gained currency, he argued that “delinking”
went against globalizing trends and was unrealistic. The correct solution would
be for the developing countries to use their resources in a manner which
empowered them (counterpenetration) rather than allow the North to reduce those
countries to further dependency. Delinking would involve under-utilizing their
resources. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali Mazrui even developed five strategies for making
developing countries less dependent upon the North. These strategies were what
he called <i>indigenization</i> (emphasizing indigenous resources and skills), <i>domestication</i>
(making imported institutions like universities more relevant); <i>diversification</i>
(diversifying crops, trading partners, aid donors); <i>horizontal integration</i>
<i>or interpenetration</i> ( greater unity among less developed economies) and <i>vertical
counterpenetration</i> (increasing the power of developing countries upon the
North—as South Korea has done or the countries of OPEC have tried to do from
time to time). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;

Mazrui reactivated his wider interest in the Islamic religion and in Islamic
civilization. Moreover, Muslim viewers of the television series— who had
previously thought of Mazrui only as an Africanist—suddenly discovered an
Islamic side to Mazrui, both as a person and as a scholar. In the United States
this resulted in the growth of a whole new academic constituency for Mazrui as
different Muslim organizations turned to him. They invited him initially as a
public speaker, but later he was called upon to be a member of Governing Boards

continued until his controversial Reith Lectures for the British Broadcasting
Corporation in 1979. In his sixth lecture he recommended nuclear proliferation
in Africa as a way of shocking the nuclear Big Powers to give up nuclear
weapons altogether.<sup>17</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> At least as controversial was his recommendation in the
1990s that stronger African states should be prepared to <i>“recolonize”</i>
temporarily weaker African countries whose state-institutions had collapsed. He
suggested that Tanganyika had “recolonized” Zanzibar in the wake of the
Zanzibar revolution of 1964 and created the United Republic of Tanzania. More
defensible was Tanzania’s temporary occupation of Uganda in 1979 to get rid of
Idi Amin. Should Nigeria have temporarily recolonized Sierra Leone in the 1990s?
Was there temporary colonization of Rwanda by Uganda in 1994 through proxies in
a bid to end the anti-Tutsi genocide? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> One of the important roles that Ali Mazrui has played in
American higher education has been to raise uncomfortable questions and
initiate fundamental debates in classrooms as well as in the media. Mazrui’s
“recolonization” thesis was first publicized through a syndicated article for
the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, which was published worldwide and translated in
many languages. The most widely read English version appeared in the <i>International
Herald Tribune</i> (Paris, dated 4th August 1994). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> A special kind of conflict and response has been Mazrui’s
attention to slavery and reparations. In 1992 Ali Mazrui and eleven others were
“sworn in” by Africa’s presidents to create a new body called Group of Eminent
Persons on Africa’s Reparations for Enslavement, Bondage and Exploitation
(GEP). The Group elected Chief Moshood Abiola as its Chair. In June 1993 Abiola
was elected President of Nigeria but he was never allowed by the military to
assume office. Instead, he was imprisoned and died in detention in 1998. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:2.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Ali A. Mazrui, Professor Jacob Ade Ajayi of Ibadan
University and Ambassador Dudley Thompson of Jamaica have kept the Reparations
flame alive by having the issue debated every year at the annual meetings of
the African Studies Association (ASA), of the United States. In the year 2000
they also involved, a major African-American speaker at the ASA, Randall
Robinson, whose Trans Africa Forum (Washington, DC) had adopted reparations for
African Americans as its latest crusade. Randall Robinson had himself just
published a book entitled <i>The Debt</i> precisely on the issue of
reparations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:3.15pt;

on what he calls “the triple heritage of African slavery—indigenous, Islamic
and Western.” Mazrui was less impressed by Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. of
Harvard University and his television series <i>Wonders of the African World</i>.
In a heated Internet debate from the United States, Mazrui accused Gates of
blaming the trans-Atlantic slave trade primarily on Africans themselves, thus
“letting the White man off the hook.” Mazrui’s critique of Gates’ TV series
remains the most highly publicized and the most often-quoted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
