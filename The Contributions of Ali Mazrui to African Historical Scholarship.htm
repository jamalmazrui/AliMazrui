style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Professor Ali AL-Amin Mazrui was a
political scientist, writer, scholar and commentator of many intellectual
issues whose books, documentaries and lectures have created a positive image
for Africa. Although with no historical background, Mazrui’s widely watched TV
series and works generally challenged the Eurocentric perception of a stagnant,
colorless, stateless, unscientific and predatory Africa. This research,
therefore attempts a search light on the life, times and works of Mazrui with
emphasis on his contribution to African historical scholarship. The paper
relies on secondary sources, Mazrui’s interviews with the press as well as
documentaries on Africa. It concludes that in spite of the toga attached to him
as a controversial figure; this celebrated political scientist was a historian
at heart and a torch bearer for the Africa continent.</span><b> </b></i></p>

professor of political science was born on the 24<sup>th</sup> February, 1933
into the renowned Mazrui dynasty of Mombassa in Kenya, East Africa. The Mazrui
clan from which he descended was a highly religious Islamic family whose
descendants were known in history as great scholars, rulers and jurist that
ruled Mombassa for more than 100years-up to 1837 (Mazrui, 1995). Ali Mazrui’s
father was a chief judge also called Grand Khadi and a descendant of Islamic
jurists (Mazrui, 1985). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:8.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>With a strong Islamic heritage it was not surprising that
young Ali’s education would revolve around Quranic schools where Islamic
studies and theology were taught to young Muslims. The older Mazrui was
enthusiastic that after his son’s secondary education, he would attend the
prestigious Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt one of the great citadels of
Islamic learning. This plan failed to materialize as the older Mazrui died
leaving his son at the age of fourteen (Media Chat with Ali Mazrui, 2008).Mazrui
grew up and taught at the Mombassa Institute of Muslim Education (MIOME) where
he had contact with British instructors who assisted him in securing a
scholarship to school in Britain. In spite of Mazrui quest for Western
education, he upheld the Islamic religion and improved upon his knowledge of
Arabic through Arabic courses he offered at the University of Manchester. </p>

schooling abroad, not at home, that sowed the seeds of Africanism in him. The
reason may not be farfetched. Indeed, the years that spanned between his under
graduate and post graduate years were the years (1950’s to 60’s) when the
agitation for independence among African countries were at their peak.
Accordingly, students of African origin in Europe were clamouring for independence,
and back home, political parties like the Action Group and Nigeria Council of
Nigerian Citizens (NCNC) in Nigeria and CPP in Ghana amongst others were formed
with the aim of providing a medium of expression to secure political freedom
(Olusanya, 1980). Kwame </p>

resulted in the multiplication of African Studies and Research Centers in the
United States (Uya, 2004). Similarly, the Black Studies Movement of the late
1960’s gave impetus to African studies. It was in this milieu that Ali Mazrui
wrote and successfully defended his PhD thesis in 1966 which dwelt on the
post-colonial Anglophone Africa. There is no doubt that the cultural setting at
the time of his studies in Europe made Mazrui a champion for the cause of
Africa. His publications, series of lectures and commentaries, even his
activities in student unionism portrayed that, in a country where the majority
were Europeans, Mazrui still believed in being an African. As a student, he
showed signs of a political activist who contested for and was elected
president of the African Students Association in Manchester. This enthusiasm to
play a key role in African affairs even while based abroad and a student
continued during his Master’s programme in the United States and his PhD at
Oxford. </p>

political science, Islamic studies, African studies, cultural studies and
literature. This has earned him the name “multiple Mazrui.” Yet his greatest
contribution has been in African and Islamic studies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:6.35pt;

from his father who was a pamphleteer in the Swahili and Arabic languages
stating that “my father was constantly engaged in debates over social reforms
and theological interpretations of Islam.” (Media Chat with Ali Mazrui, 2008). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:5.35pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The first three books published by Mazrui includes,
“Towards a Pax Africana” (Mazrui, 1967a), a published version of his PhD
thesis; The Anglo-African Commonwealth (Mazrui, 1967b) and “On Heroes and Uhuru
Worship: Essays on Independent Africa” (Mazrui, 1967c). As a graduate student,
Mazrui had written extensively on Africa’s political experience in professional
Journals like “American Political Science Review” in the United States and
“Political Studies”, a British journal. His first article in a major western
newspaper in Britain, “Why does an African feel African” was accepted and
published with no corrections or alterations whatsoever (Media Chat with Ali
Mazrui, 2008).Mazrui also became a regular face of the British Broadcasting
Service in the 70s where he lectured on topics and issues relating to African
condition. These lectures culminated in the publication of a book, “The African
Condition” in 1980 (Mazrui, 1980). Mazrui’s lectures and commentaries were not
only broadcast in English but in Kiswahili and heard on radio from London to
Africa (Media Chat with Ali Mazrui, 2008). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:6.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Towards a Pax Africa, Mazrui’s first book emphasizes the
need for Africans to be their own policeman by being less dependent on the
western world and assuming responsibility for their own peace and stability on
their continent. Similarly, in a public lecture he delivered in Lagos in 2000,
thirty-three years after his first publication, his theme remained the same in
this lecture titled, The African Renaissance: A Triple Legacy of Skills, Values
and Gender (Mazrui, 2000). He defined development as, modernization minus
dependency (Mazrui, 2000), and insists that one strategy of overcoming
dependency is through indigenization hence increased utilization of indigenous
techniques, personnel and approaches to purposeful change (Mazrui, 2000). He
maintained that indigenized modernization would include the greater use of
African languages in the pursuit of scientific, economic and constitutional
change. Mazrui added that, no country had ascended to a first rank
technological and economic power through the excessive dependence on foreign
languages. Citing Japan and Korea as case studies, Mazrui averred that the
former rose to its dazzling industrial height by scientific ting the Japanese
language and making it the medium of its own industrialization (Mazrui, 2000). </p>

Pan-African and anti-colonial stance which were emphasized in his first book
became strongly expressed in all his over 20 books and hundreds of articles

celebrated scholar although it was his first three books published in 1967 when
he started his career in 1963 at the Makerere University, Uganda that propelled
him to enviable heights. He rose to become the first full African professor in
Political Science in East Africa and the first Black professor in social
sciences in English speaking Africa.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:0in;

convergence of three civilizations which he (Nkrumah) called “conscientism” but
which he (Mazrui) refer to as “Africa’s Triple Heritage” (Media Chat with Ali
Mazrui, 2008). This concept was later elaborated upon and televised in the
popular BBC/PBC television series titled, The Africans: A Triple Heritage
(1986). This television program became widely televised and viewed by millions
of people from across the world. Part of the Triple Heritage clips captured
civilizations from Africa which punctured the Eurocentric perspective of
Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper, professor of modern History at Oxford and his
European cohorts that “Africa had no history”. It was always a delight to watch
Professor Ali Mazrui moving from one civilization to another showcasing Africa
as a historical part of the world where scientific development were present and
civilization took place. For this writer, Mazrui’s contribution to African
historical scholarship reached its peak through this memorable project. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>Although Ali Mazrui’s works in various disciplines earned
him the name “multiple Mazrui”, yet scholars have criticized his inability to
examine subjects in an in-depth manner. Ironically, among Mazrui’s critics were
African scholars. Like the proverbial saying “a prophet is never respected in
his country”, James Karioki maintained that Mazrui was criticized because of
his non-commitment to the aspirations of Africa (karioki, 1974). Karioki
further states that “they perceive him as an aloof polemicist who is quick to
announce and condemn the failure of the continent without suggesting seriously
thought-out alternatives” (karioki, 1974). One tends to disagree with this
perception of Mazrui and notes that Mazrui has actually contributed and made
suggestions on the way forward for the African continent in the various books
he authored. There are others who see Mazrui’s works as always causing
controversy, and heated debates. All these never worried Mazrui in his life
time. He believed in his interdisciplinary style of writing without owing
allegiance to any discipline. In his words,<span style='font-size:13.0pt;

governance, but in the politics of the human condition as a whole. My range is
from the politics of religion to the politics of language and literature. There
is a sense in which I’m also a political philosopher (Mazrui, 2000). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:8.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For this writer, Ali Mazrui has done an excellent work in
African studies and by extension promoted African historical scholarship. His
consistency in preaching Africanism which runs through all his works in spite
of his education abroad marks him out as a true patriot, a worthy son and a
torch-bearer for the African people. Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta,
described Mazrui as one of Africa’s greatest scholars whose “Intellectual
Contributions played a major role in shaping African scholarship (www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29595175).
History will always remember him as an intellectual genius, whose scholarly
contribution placed Africa in the limelight of world history. </p>

Kenyan Government Scholarship to complete his secondary education in England
from where he proceeded to a British University. There he obtained a
distinction (1<sup>st</sup> Class) in the class, won a Rockfeller Foundation
Fellowship to do a Masters in Columbia University, New York and also a Nuffied
College Fellowship for his PhD in Oxford, England (Media Chat with Ali Mazrui,
2008). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In spite of all these achievements, Mazrui accepted that he
faced various challenges before attaining this height. He confessed to having a
third grade (just Pass) in 1949 in the Cambridge School Certificate Examination
in Mombasa and was not qualified for college; He was rejected by various
institutions in Europe, North America, India, Australia and even the Arab world
when he applied for scholarships for about four to five years; He failed to be
employed as a junior clerk in Mombasa </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:5.4pt;

refuse to accept that situation as a final word about my career” (Media Chat
with Ali Mazrui, 2008). This is because this brilliant teacher and researcher
believed in the adage “if at first you don’t succeed try and try again.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Ali Mazrui had strong reasons to profess Africanism. His
physical ties to various African countries knew no bounds. Yet there were some
particular African countries that stood out and had strong bearings on his
life. These include Kenya, his birth place and Nationality; Uganda, the birth
place of his academic career and country where he first attained professional
prominence; Nigeria, the country of his wife, Pauline Uti and place which
inspired emotions of his novel-The Trial of Christopher Okigbo (Media Chat with
Ali Mazrui, 2008). It was also here that the Nigerian Television Authority
accepted to partner with the British Broadcasting Authority and Public
Broadcasting Service in the </p>

Heritage. Ghana had an impact of Mazrui’s PhD thesis while undergoing the
program at Oxford. Tanzania, according to Mazrui was the vanguard of his
Kiswahili culture. He further recalled that, although Kiswahili was his mother
tongue, the language was promoted even more than it was in Kenya, his land of
birth (Media Chat with Ali Mazrui, 2008). Finally South Africa was the first
country other than his own to award him a national honor (Grand Companion of
Oliver Tambo) in April 2007 (Media Chat with Ali Mazrui, 2008). It was also in
this country that Abdul Bemath, a South African Liberian and Biographer
produced the first annotated biography of his works from 1963 to date (Media
Chat with Ali Mazrui, 2008). This was done in both electronic and print forms. </p>

scholar of international repute. His resilience is worthy of emulation. </p>
