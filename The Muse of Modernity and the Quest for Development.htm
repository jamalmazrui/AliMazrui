Essay for the book project provisionally entitled <u>The Heart and the Mind in
African Development:  Culture and Development</u>, edited by Philip G. Altbach
and Salah Hassan (1996).  The Editors subsequently adopted the title of
Mazrui’s chapter for the title of their whole book.  (Trenton, NJ: Africa World
Press, 1997). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Let us confront issues like culture,
development modernization and dependency frontally.   What do they all mean? 
What is their significance for African societies?  Let us first deal with the
complex role of culture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Culture is relevant for development because of
the seven functions which culture plays in society.  When culture functions as <u>lenses
of perception</u>, it influences how people view themselves and their
environment.  For example, African cultural concepts of immortality have
influenced attitudes to family-size and population growth.  Many Africans
believe that no person is really dead for as long as the person's blood flows
in the veins of the living.  Having many children therefore improves a parent's
chances of immortality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Translated in modern terms, no person is really
dead as long as the person's genes are still among the living.  It is therefore
rational to maximize one's genetic legacy by having many children. This
conception of immortality has contributed towards making population growth in
Africa the fastest in the world, with implications for development - for better
or for worse.         Another function of culture is when it serves as a <u>spring
of motivation</u>.  What people respond to as incentives or disincentives for
certain patterns of behaviour is a phenomenon which is greatly influenced by
culture.  It is for this reason that the <u>work ethic</u> is very often a
product of such cultural configurations as Max Weber's concept of &quot;the
Protestant ethic&quot; and the more recent phenomenon of work-a-holic behaviour
among Japanese executives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Is the work-ethic in Africa cultivated or
stifled by culture?  Has the work-ethic been damaged by the consequences of the
colonial experience?  Is the work-ethic among African women stronger than among
African men?  Culturally, have African men been damaged more than African
women?  Needless to say, the work-ethic has enormous implications for
development.  In the final analysis, the work-ethic is a cultural imperative. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Culture also serves as a <u>standard of
judgment</u>.  What is right or wrong, what is virtuous or evil, what is
beautiful or ugly are all greatly conditioned by culture.  What constitutes
corruption?  Why is taking a chicken to a Chief in traditional society
acceptable as a form of salutation but rejected as bribery in modern society? 
Is the problem of corruption in Africa compounded by the clash of standards of
judgment between the traditional and the modern?  Is moral fluidity itself a
consequence of a clash of cultures? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            The fourth function of culture is in terms of
its role as the <u>basis of stratification</u>.  Rank, caste, and class are all
profoundly conditioned by, if not created by, culture.  There is in addition
traditional <u>gender</u> stratification. In most sub-Saharan traditional
cultures, women were culturally supposed to have a triple custodial role - as
custodians of fire, water, and earth.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            As <u>custodian of fire</u> the African woman
finds herself in charge of rural Africa's most important source of domestic
energy - firewood.  She treks long distances to collect it.  As <u>custodian of
water</u>, the African woman ensures water-supply for the home and for the
extended family.  Again she often walks a mile or two to the lake or river
(unless a well is more readily available). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            As for the woman's role as <u>custodian of
earth</u>, this is linked to the concept of <u>dual fertility</u> - the
fertility of the womb (woman as mother) and the fertility of the soil (woman as
cultivator).  In many African countries even today women are the majority of
the farmers - as well as being major suppliers of domestic water and firewood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            What role does culture allocate to <u>men</u>? 
In societies of mixed husbandry, males (both boys and men) are in charge of the
larger domestic animals like cattle or camels.  Some cultures allocate
responsibility for all domestic mammals (goats, sheep, etc.) to males - leaving
only poultry in the hands of women.  Men fell trees so that women can use
branches for firewood.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.05pt;margin-bottom:
.2pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Men go to cities or mines to work for wage-labour
while their womenfolk remain on the farm.     A new division of labour emerged
with some colonial economies - women cultivated food-crops like yam and maize
while men took charge of cash crops like cocoa, cotton and coffee.  But in
places like Karicho in Kenya it is still women who pick the tea-leaves at
harvest time.  It is considerations such as these which make cultural awareness
indispensable for effective development planning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>              The fifth
function of culture is as <u>means of communication</u>.  Culture provides all
sorts of </p>

<div class=WordSection2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>nuances in communication and intimation.  But above all
culture provides language in the literal sense of the legacy of words and
lexicon. We shall return to this function of culture more fully in relation to
the potential of indigenous African languages in development.  Can any country
approximate first rank economic development if it relies overwhelmingly on
foreign languages for its discourse on development and transformation.  Will
Africa ever effectively take off when it is held hostage so tightly to the
languages of its former imperial powers?  We shall return to this theme later
in this analysis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            The sixth function of culture is precisely in
defining <u>production and consumption</u> and influencing them.  Cultures
differ widely in productivity not only in the world as a whole but also within
Africa.  Are the Kikuyu in Kenya really more productive than the Maasai?  Are
the Igbo in Nigeria really more productive than the Tiv?  Are the differences
between the groups cultural?  Clearly development planners cannot ignore such
considerations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>             This brings
us to the final function of culture - which is culture as a <u>basis of
identity</u>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Culture is crucial in defining the &quot;we&quot; and the
&quot;they&quot; and marking the frontiers of solidarity.  Indeed, what
constitutes a Kikuyu or a Maasai, an Igbo or a Tiv, is pre-eminently a function
of such cultural variables as lineage-systems, kinship and language.  How can
development tap into the fountains of identity to achieve results? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            These then are the seven functions of culture -
as lenses of perception, spring of motivation, standard of judgment, basis of
stratification, means of communication, patterns of production and consumption,
and culture as a basis of identity.  Whether development likes it or not, it is
caught up in the complex configuration of those seven functions of culture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            But our conceptual problems are by no means
over.  We still have to grapple with what the process of <u>development</u> is
all about.  There are issues of definition, process, and goals involved.  Let
us look more closely. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:
172%'>            What is development?  One possible answer is that development
is modernization minus dependency.  But what is modernization?  One possible
answer is that modernization is change which is compatible with the present
stage of human knowledge, which seeks to comprehend the legacy of the past,
which is sensitive to the needs of the future, and which is increasingly aware
of its global context.  This is the positive interpretation of modernization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            If development equals modernization minus
dependency, and we have defined modernization, what then is dependency? 
Dependency could mean either surplus need or deficit control.  Country B is
dependent on country A if country B <u>needs</u> country A more than the other
way round (surplus <u>need</u>). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Another sense of dependency is <u>deficit
control</u>.  Country B is dependent on country A if country B has less <u>control</u>
over their relationship than country B has. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Where does <u>culture</u> enter into this?  If
development equals modernization minus dependency, there is not doubt about the
relevance of African culture in at least that part of the equation which
concerns &quot;minus dependence&quot;.  African culture is central to this
process of reducing dependency in the dialectic of modernization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            One strategy of transcending dependency is <u>indigenization</u>. 
This includes greater utilization of indigenous techniques, personnel, and
approaches to purposeful change.  Indigenized modernization would include
greater use of African <u>languages</u> in the pursuit of economic and
constitutional change.  As stated earlier, no country has ascended to a first
rank economic power by excessive dependence on foreign languages.  Japan rose
to dazzling industrial heights by scientificating the Japanese language and
making it the medium of its own industrialization.  Korea has approximately
scientificated the Korean language and made it the medium of its own
technological take-off.  Can Africa ever take-off technologically if it remains
so overwhelmingly dependent on European languages for discourse on advanced learning? 
Can Africa look to the future if it is not adequately sensitive to the cultural
past?  Culture as <u>communication</u> and culture as <u>production</u> need to
converge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            When two Japanese physicists meet to discuss a
problem in physics, it is now possible for them to discuss it in the Japanese
language.  When two African economists (let alone physicists) meet to discuss
economics, even if they come from the same linguistic group in Africa, the
chances are that they can only discuss advanced economics in a European
language.  This lingocultural gap may be disastrous for reducing dependency in
Africa's experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            But languages are not enriched only by their
scientific discourse.  The soul of each language is ultimately in creative
literature - among the poets and dramatists, among the writers and
story-tellers.  Taking African languages seriously would have to include a
patronage of the literary arts and an effort to sustain the infrastructure of
publishing in indigenous languages, as well as in international languages. 
Modernization needs some degree of ancientizaton.   In the twentieth century no
language is automatically a scientific language, but every language is
automatically a poetic language.  African languages need to be made
purposefully more scientific.  But with poetry the focus should not be on the
language of poetry but on the poets themselves - not on making the language
artificially more poetic, but on making the <u>poets</u> more naturally
productive and engaged.  The two policies of scientification of African
languages and support for African poets and writers have to be jointly persued
as part of long-term national development.  Culture as <u>communication</u> and
culture as <u>identity</u> should find a meeting point in literature. </p>

literature since 1986.  It was possible for an Arab to win it for literature

the imperial language of the <u>Other</u>.  Europe's linguistic domination of
sub-Saharan African cultures is more uncompromising than Europe's domination
of, say, the Arab world.  Is this a case of culture as <u>stratification</u>? 
Is this a rank order of races?  Or a stratification of cultures? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

works written in Japanese;  a South Asian for masterly use of Bengali, Urdu or
Hindi;  a Frenchman for the genius of the French language;  and an Egyptian did
win the prize for creative accomplishments in Arabic.    However, for the
foreseeable future, the Nobel Prize for literature is unlikely to be awarded
for brilliant use of an indigenous African language.  Are we waiting for
modernization to come?  Or are we waiting for dependence to leave?  In this
domain the linguistic <u>Other</u> has precluded the linguistic <u>Self</u>
from ever being noticed as being of literary relevance.  Is this &quot;great
chain of being&quot; racial or cultural? </p>

1913 when India was still decidedly a British dependency.  The works for which
he won the Nobel Prize were in Indian languages, especially Bengali.  He
created from his linguistic womb.  But in Africa the Euro-Other still inhabits
the Afro-Self.  When does race end and culture begin?  They say African
languages are not modernized enough.  Or is this a case of Africa itself not
being independent enough?             When Tagore won the Nobel Prize for
literature written in Bengali <u>before</u> the first intracivilizational war
(World War I) it must have looked like a major step towards a Concert of
Cultures, a step towards a partnership of civilizations.  Even after making
allowances for the influence of W.B. Yeats behind the Nobel scenes, even after
allowing for the fact that the award of the prize was probably aided by the
fact that Tagore had personally translated a number of his works into English,
the award signalled not a clash of civilizations but the potentialities of
parity of esteem across cultural divides. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

Africa.  We need to elevate African languages.  The global culture of <u>stratification</u>

For example, the Western-style university is basically a foreign institution in
Africa, and yet every African country has attempted to reproduce it, often in
unabashed imitativeness.  Some of those African campuses were previously
overseas extensions of European universities.  Makerere in Uganda, Legon in
Ghana and Ibadan in Nigeria started as overseas colonial extensions of the
University of London, producing graduates with degrees of the British
university.  Universite Lovanium in Belgian Congo (now Zaire) was conceptually
an extension of Louvain University in Belgium. </p>

to make those African extensions more and more relevant to Africa in terms of
the subjects they taught, the methods they used, the goals they sought to
realize, and the actual people who taught the courses and made policy.  In
reality it has not been easy to Africanize African universities.  In fact, many
of them are now decaying, partly because they were not adequately relevant to
the needs of their societies, and partly because they were not culturally designed
in the image of their societies.  They remained </p>

strategy of domestication, the most relevant translations are from foreign to

that of <u>diversification</u>.  In agricultural production that could mean
diversifying the range of crops which a country cultivates for both domestic
consumption and export.  It could mean diversifying a country's markets abroad,
to make sure that the country is not too dependent on one or two overseas
outlets for its products.  Multilateral aid is a form of diversification as
compared with bilateral aid.  During the Cold War nonaligned countries were
even able to diversity their &quot;masters&quot;, playing one against the other.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            In 1868, after the Meiji restoration, the
Japanese asked themselves:  &quot;Can we economically modernize without
culturally westernizing?&quot;.  They embarked on a crusade of selective
industrialization under the slogan of &quot;Western technique, Japanese
spirit&quot;.  Fifty years later they had become an industrial power to reckon
with.  Their culture of <u>motivation</u> was highly stimulated. What was there
in Japanese culture additionally, which enabled them to remain so Japanese
culturally and still pull off an industrial miracle before World War II?  How
did culture as <u>identity</u> and culture as <u>production</u> converge? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

Americans following their surrender after the use of the atomic bomb on their
cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  When the occupation ended Japan started its
second industrial miracle - less culturally selective than the first, but even
more technologically triumphant.  What was there in Japanese culture which made
such miracles happen? </p>

been without its costs.  The culture of production has been allied to Japan's
culture of stratification.  The environment has often paid dearly, the Japanese
women have remained marginalized, the ethnic minorities in the country have
been exploited without adequate recognition.  But Africa needs to look eastward
towards the Japanese experience, as well as northwards towards Europe and
westward towards North America, for cultural insights relevant to modernization
and development. </p>

Senegal's Renaissance Man who died in 1986, belonged more to the gloriana
school.  He spent much of his life demonstrating Africa's contributions to
global civilization.  And he was most emphatic that the civilization of
pharaonic Egypt was a <u>black</u> civilization.  This was all in the grand
Pan-African tradition of romantic gloriana.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            <u>What of the reality of Africa</u>?  It was a
fusion of the simple and the complex, the cattleherder and the castle-builder. 
It was <u>more</u> than romantic primitivism and romantic gloriana.  Real
Pan-Africanism must go beyond the twin stimuli of poetry and imperialism.               Pan-Africanism
of <u>economic</u> integration will be led by Southern Africa with the new
community which has added South Africa to the old SADCC fraternity.  The
success of this economic sub-regional integration will be partly because one
member of the new economic fraternity (Southern African Development Community -
SADC) is more equal than the others - the Republic of South Africa.  A pivotal
state often helps to assure the success of regional integration.  But a shared
sense of Africanity will also be needed to sustain SADC.  The culture of
identity needs to be allied to political stratification in the quest for
economic development.         The old European Economic Community soon after
1958 survived partly because some members were definitely more equal than
others.  Again, here was political stratification.  The Franco-German axis was,
under Charles de Gaulle, more &quot;Franco&quot; than German.  But now German
economic might has restored the balance in the new European Union.  However, a
shared European culture was also needed all along to sustain unification.  The
culture of identity was invoked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Similarly, Southern Africa has the advantage of
having one member indisputably &quot;the first among equals&quot; - the
Republic of South Africa.  The pivotal power is the premise of regional
survival.  But a regional identity has to be culturally strengthened to sustain
long term unity.            Pan-Africanism of <u>lingo-cultural</u> integration
will probably be led by East Africa with its good fortune of a region-wide
indigenous language - the role of Kiswahili binding Tanzania, Kenya, to some
extent Uganda, Somalia, and potentially Rwanda, Burundi, and Eastern Zaire. 
Northern Mozambique and Malawi are also feeling Swahili influence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Swahili is spoken by more people than any other
indigenous language of Africa.  It will hit its first 100 million people early
in the 21st Century if not sooner.  Kiswahili is expanding more rapidly than
any other lingua franca in the continent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Pan-Africanism of <u>political</u> integration
will probably be led by <u>North</u> Africa.  There is already a kind of
economic cooperation fraternity binding five countries - Libya, Tunisia,
Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania.  The economic cooperation has been limping
along.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>However, Egypt has now expressed an interest in joining
this movement towards greater North African regional integration.  The
sub-region is still a long way from political integration, but it is the best
placed in Africa for such an adventure - since it shares a religion (Islam), a
language (Arabic), a culture (Arabo-Berber) and a substantial shared history
across centuries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Part of the stimulus for North Africa's
integration will be European integration.  The economies of North Africa and
Southern Europe are to some extent competitive.  The deeper integration of
countries like Spain and Portugal and Greece into an enlarged European Union is
ringing economic alarm bells in North Africa.  This could help Pan-Africanism
in Arab Africa.       Pan-Africanism of <u>military</u> integration is likely
to be led by West Africa - with the precedent set by ECOMOG under the Economic
Community of West African States [ECOWAS].  Inspite of the difficulties and
inconclusiveness of ECOMOG's attempted rescue operation in Liberia, the effort
has been a major pioneering enterprise in the history of <u>Pax </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            But this issue is precisely the Achilles' heel
of Pan Africanism as a whole.  Who will keep the peace in Africa as we approach
the end of the millennium?  Many institutions will be needed.  What will also
be needed to sustain those institutions will be greater and greater horizontal
integration and cultural synthesis.  Again a culture of identity needs to be
tapped for regional cooperation. </p>

that of <u>counterpenetration</u>.  This strategy involves infiltrating the
infiltrators - counterpenetrating the citadels of power.  Since we have defined
modernization partly in terms of sensitivity to one's global context,
counterpenetrating the powerful is a search for a more balanced globalization. 
It is a quest for a more symmetrical interdependence. </p>

to use its raw materials as a source of influence in the world rather than as a
basis of dependency.  For a brief decade (1973-1983) the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) exerted some leverage on the world economy
on a significant scale.  Petro-power from the Third World briefly
counterpenetrated the commanding heights of the world economy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>            Then there is demographic counterpenetration. 
Irish Americans are a demographic lobby for Irish interests in the United
States;  Jewish Americans are a demographic lobby for the state of Israel. 
Some African Americans like those who support TransAfrica are a demographic
lobby for Africa on Capitol Hill.  All of these are cases of demographic
counterpenetration.  So is the case of African professors teaching young
Americans in US colleges and universities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;

terms to the wider world could also be not only counterpenetrative but also
modernizing for that wider world.  The globalization of African culture is a
modernizing imperative, provided it is done without exploiting Africa. </p>
