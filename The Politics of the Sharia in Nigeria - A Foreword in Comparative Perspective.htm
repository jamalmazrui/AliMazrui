Islamic Law and Politics in Northern Nigeria, 1803-2007</i> by Ricardo René
Larémont, under consideration for publication 2011. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><i> </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Perhaps never before has the study of
Islamic law in one African country been placed in as wide a context of
comparative law as has the Sharia movement in Nigeria in this volume.  Ricardo
René Larémont is knowledgeable not only about Islamic law but also about the
history of Western canon law, Roman jurisprudence, Germanic legal systems,
European customary law and the impact of all these on Anglo-American juridical
principles of both common law and statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Professor Larémont also comes to his
subject-matter fluent in English, French and Spanish languages, and competent
in reading Arabic, some Hausa and some Latin.        His primary geographical
focus in this book is Nigeria.  This country constitutes the largest
concentration of Muslims on the African continent.  It is not often realized
that the part of Nigeria which is Muslim is larger than the number of Muslims
in any single </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Arab country, including Egypt.  If thirteen states
out of Nigeria’s federation of thirty six states are now governed mainly in
conformity with the Sharia, Nigeria has become one of the largest
constituencies of Islamic Law in the world.  Over seventy million Nigerians
were partly governed according to the Sharia, as the 21<sup>st</sup> century
unfolded.       This volume identifies some of the trends which resulted in
this <i>Shariacracy</i> movement in Nigeria.  British colonial policy of
Indirect Rule had allowed considerable autonomy to Islamic institutions in the
northern Emirates of Nigeria.  Islamic Law continued to be administered in
those Emirates, with such colonial limitations as the British deemed
appropriate.  For example, the British abolished such <i>hududs</i> as
amputation of the hand for theft and outlawed the death penalty for adultery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
1.75pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            After the end of British rule in 1960
the Sharia in Northern Nigeria began to decline in importance, in spite of the
Muslim pre-eminence in the composition of the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Federal Government of Nigeria for much of the first
decades of Nigeria’s independence.   The first big setback to Nigerian Muslims
was the military coup of January 1966, which killed Nigeria’s first
postcolonial Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and killed also the
even more powerful Northern Nigerian Muslim, the Sardauna of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Northerners later took their revenge
against the overwhelmingly Christian Igbo in deadly riots.  The stage was set
not only for the escalating politicization of sectarianism, but also for the
outbreak of the Nigerian civil war of 1967 to 1970.  The war was between the
secessionist eastern Nigeria led by the Igbo on one side, and on the other, the
rest of Nigeria led by the new Federal Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon. 
Although the Federal side was led by a devout Christian, General Gown, the war
was widely and wrongly interpreted as a confrontation between Christians and
Muslims in Nigeria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            The nine years of Yakubu Gowon’s rule
(1966-1975) constituted a sharing of power between Christians and Muslims,
although the Head of State was a Christian.  But the overthrow of General Gowon
in a bloodless military coup in 1975 resulted in the rise of Brigadier (later
General) Murtala Muhammad, who is still widely regarded as the most heroic and
charismatic of all Muslim Heads of State of postcolonial Nigeria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Murtala was an ambitious reformer who
wanted to establish greater discipline and minimize corruption in Nigeria.  He
did get rid of a large number of corrupt or idle officials, and created many
enemies in the process.   He was subsequently assassinated.  Today he has
Nigeria’s most important airport (the Lagos airport) named after him.  Of all
Muslim leaders of postcolonial Nigeria, Murtala continues to be remembered in
heroic terms by millions of Nigerian Christians, as well as Muslims. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            While politically <u>Muslims</u> during
those years seemed to be on the rise, the influence of <u>Islam</u> was
declining as a cultural and legal force.  This was partly because of the
expansion of the Federal Government’s role at the expense of the Emirs. </p>

the first elected Muslim President of Nigeria, Al-Haji Shehu Shagari.  Shagari
completed his first term as President, and was re-elected for a second term. 
Muslims at the federal level continued to be politically triumphant, but Islam
at the state level continued to decline as a jurisprudential force.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Federal governmental and judicial institutions
continued to overshadow the old Emirates’ systems of authority and the Kadhis’
courts.  Muslims were indeed on the rise, but Islam was getting marginalized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Shehu Shagari was overthrown early in his
second term, and was succeeded by a series of Muslim military rulers of Nigeria
– generals Muhammad Buhari and Ibrahim Babangida, and the deputy of general
Buhari, Tunde Idiagbon.  These military rulers were good news for Nigerian
Muslims, but not necessarily for Islam in the Emirates.  Even the notorious
General Sani Abacha, though himself a depraved Muslim, maintained the federal
pre-eminence of Muslims in the central government. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            It was from the mid-1990s that Northern
Nigerian Muslims began to recognize not only the declining influence of Islam
in their lives, but their own declining influence in the national politics of
Nigeria.  When the first non-Northern Nigerian Muslim was elected President in
June 1993, the Nigerian military as a whole vetoed his ascent to the Headship
of State.  The successful candidate, Bashorun M.K.O. Abiola, ended up in
prison, and died not long afterwards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            As so often happens, the decline of
Muslims in the national politics of Nigeria helped to reactivate their sense of
cultural identity, including their pride in their religion.  The Shariacracy
movement was partly a response to this new situation.  The relative
marginalization of Muslims at the Federal Level resulted in the greater
empowerment of Islam at the State Level.  The result was the adoption of the
Sharia by one Nigerian state after another, beginning with Zanfara state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>            But this
historical interpretation of mine does not do justice to Ricardo </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Larémont’s agenda in this volume.  By placing Nigeria
in a wider analytical context, Larémont has addressed not only comparative
religion but also comparative jurisprudence.  He argues that Anglo-American law
has evolved into emphasizing the integrity of the process rather than the
equity of the outcome.  The Sharia, on the other hand, leans more towards the
pursuit of a just outcome rather than the protection of the legal process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            However, on certain matters the Sharia
has rules of evidence which are truly stringent.  When one of the Nigerian
Muslim states condemned an unmarried pregnant woman, Amina Lawal, to death for
adultery without meting out a similar sentence to the offending man, the
outpouring of protests came from the rest of the Muslim world, as well as from
Western critics.  Under the proper Sharia, the death sentence for adultery
required exceptionally demanding evidence.  Indeed witnesses to the actual
sexual act are necessary before the death penalty can be invoked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Other Muslim critics outside Nigeria
argued that the offending male in the case was more liable under the real
Sharia than Amina – since it was the fact that the man was <u>married</u> which
made the sexual act “adultery.”   Amina Lawal had highlighted the problem of
the <u>hudud</u> (ancestral Islamic punishments); although in the end she was
not executed after all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Comparatively, Ricardo Larémont refers us
to Pakistan where 89% of those charged with <i>Zina</i> (adultery) are women,
and overwhelmingly from rural and underprivileged classes.  Fortunately,
Larémont draws our attention to the fact the Federal Sharia Court of Pakistan
reverses more than half of <i>Zina</i> convictions from lower courts.  Less
than twenty-percent of the severe<i> </i><u>punishments</u> of the lower courts
are in fact upheld on appeal in Pakistan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Ricardo Larémont addresses the
conservatism of Wahabi Islam (linked to the Sunni Hanbali denomination) and
stemming from the influence of Saudi Arabia.  This version of Islam goes to the
extent of forbidding women even to drive a car.  Larémont salutes Sufism as a
gentler form of Islam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>             But Nigerian
Muslims might also study even those contradictions of Pakistan.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The same country which still practices the severe <u>hudud</u>,
and culturally triggers the unIslamic honor killings of sexually unfaithful
wives, or sexually offending daughters, was the country which produced Islam’s
first female Head of Government, the late Benazir Bhutto.  She served twice as
Prime Minister of Pakistan long before the United States has had a female
President, or Italy a female Prime Minister, or France a female President, or
even Germany a female Chancellor before 2005.  Benazir Bhutto was assassinated
when she was pursuing a third term as prime minister. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            In reality Asian Islam has sometimes
empowered women to a higher level not only than have Christian countries in the
West but also than has almost the whole of Africa.  Bangladesh has alternated
between two women Heads of Government (both of them Muslim) for about two
decades.  Indonesia has had a Muslim female Head of State – President Megawati
Sukarnoputri.  Although Turkey is governmentally secular, it is over eighty
percent Muslim.  Turkey has also produced a Muslim Head of Government – Tansu
Çiller. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Ricardo Larémont does not address all
these contradictions in the Muslim World as a whole, but he does remind all
those who study Islam in one geographical area to bear in mind the vast
diversity in the rest of the ummah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Even Iran reveals its surprises in
encouraging the election of Jewish, Christian and even Zoroastrian members of
the Majlis (the Parliament). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            On the other hand, Ricardo Larémont does
remind us of Iran’s intolerance towards the Bahai – treating them as apostates
from Islam, rather than as members of a distinct religion.   Apostasy in Islam
can be a capital offense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            On the gender question, Iran permits
women not only to drive a car, but also to rise high in administrative and
professional jobs. Moreover, the government reportedly finances more women than
men in Iranian universities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Africa has at last elected a female Head
of State – President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia.  She became President in
2005, elected by both Christians and Muslims of Liberia.  It may take a while
before Nigeria elects a woman president.  And if such a Nigerian female
president turns out to be a Muslim, it is more likely to be a Yoruba Muslim
than a Hausa-Fulani.  Who can be sure? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.35pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            Ricardo Larémont has given us insights
into the wider Nigerian society, and not merely the North.  He has also
introduced us to the wider ummah, and not merely to African Islam.  But above
all Larémont has opened windows into comparative jurisprudence, comparative
legal doctrine, as well as comparative religion.  Let us now allow this volume
to reveal those riches more directly.  So be it. </p>
