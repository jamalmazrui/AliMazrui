style='color:#333333'>The memorial pattern is essential in the construction of
the sense of the self. It creates the memory that we should have, and how we
shall cope with that, as an association in a revamping process. Part of what
keeps us moving, is the way looking behind of us, making sense of the work of
our elders. This is mediated by memories. Far from being a verbatim record of
the past, these memories are reconstructed with distortions and even gross
inaccuracies. If a yesterday is to be brought here and now, it’s because, to
quote Yves Valentin Mudimbe, “A now guarantees a destiny. </span><span

Kenyan American political scientist is one of Africa’s foremost political
scientists with a prestigious trajectory:  B.A. with Distinction from
Manchester University in England in 1960, M.A. from Columbia University in New
York in 1961, PhD from Nuffield College Oxford University in England in 1966;
Ali MAZRUI started his career at the Uganda’s Makerere University in Kampala.
For ten years, he served as Head of the Department of Political Science, Dean
of the Faculty of Social Sciences as well as Dean of the Faculty of Law ; while
opposing Ugandan President Idi Amin Dada who he considered ‘‘deeply
primordial’’ with a ‘‘rugged, peasant, and masculine charisma’’. In 1973, he
left the country in response to threats from state agents. From 1974 to 1991,
He moved to the University of Michigan and the State University of New York at
Binghamton where he was Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities/Professor
in Political Science, African Studies and Philosophy, Interpretation and
Culture. He founded (in 1991) and directed the Institute of Global Cultural
Studies. Mazrui also held faculty positions at other universities worldwide:
Stanford, Chicago, Nigeria, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Oxford, Harvard,
Bridgewater, Cairo, Leeds, Nairobi, Teheran, Denver, London, Ohio State,
Baghdad, McGill, Sussex, Pennsylvania, etc). He was the Andrew D. White
Professor-at-Large Emeritus and Senior Scholar in Africana Studies at Cornell
University. Ali Mazrui wrote more than 30 books on African politics and society
as well as postcolonial patterns of development and underdevelopment. </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt;text-indent:.5in'>A Scientific mentality does not prohibit
the observation of coincidences. It takes them into consideration without
drawing quick conclusions nor making confusions between correlation and
causality. In fact, twenty years ago, precisely in June 2003 when I launch my
tenure as AAPS President here in Pretoria, City of Tshwane, I met with Ali
Mazrui during a ceremony in his honor organized by the then mayor of this
Jacaranda city. It was the first time that we were meeting physically and
sharing a few agreements and disagreements on his double-faced thought:
architectonic in its ability to propose structuring ideas; polemic in its
ability to deconstruct given ideas, to generate controverses. Be it
architectonic or polemic, Ali Mazrui’s thought is a stimulating one. My
encounter with Ali Mazrui was facilitated by my friend and successor at the
position of AAPS President, Prof. Eddy Maloka. It was a symbolic one. I was
representing AAPS, a scientific association in which the preponderance of the
radical and critical thought had led in the 1970s and 1980s to the
marginalization of other currents of thought, of liberal thinkers like Ali
Marui.  Due to the path dependency of AAPS, to the Dar es Salaam intellectual
legacy structured by the liberation struggle, my encounter with Ali Mazrui was
a demonstration of a paradigmatic inclusion and inter-paradigmatic dialogue. It
led to his participation at an AAPS biennial congress in Pretoria. Twenty years
after, I have been assigned by the AAPS Executive Committee the task to deliver
the “Ali Mazrui Memorial Lecture”. I can’t derogate to my dual loyalty to AAPS
and Ali Mazrui.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>Firstly, to AAPS, the organizational loyalty is not a
straitjacket. It cohabits with individual liberty. Our choice is to contribute
to the decolonization of political science. I cannot refuse an intellectual
task because it is our duty to contribute to the dissemination and innovation
of political science ideas, to the promotion of African political science
scholars such as Ali Mazrui. The fulfilment by the African Association of
Political Science of its historic and epistemic responsibility implies necessarily
the organization of the visibility of African Political Science scholars and
the creation of favorable conditions for reception of their works. It is worth
repeating that political science in Africa should not be reduced, consciously
or unconsciously, to an enterprise of cultural domination of others without an
evaluation of their added value to understanding or the explanation. What
precedes is not an assumption of cultural or scientific chauvinism. It is just
the renewal of the appeal to render justice to African Political Science
scholars in an international cultural system that is unequal. By assigning to
me the task to deliver the first ever “Ali Mazrui Memorial Lecture”, AAPS is in
accordance with the decolonization agenda, exactly like other African
scientific organizations such as CODESRIA. Here and now, let me underscore that
decolonization, more precisely scientific decolonization, doesn’t mean closure,
nor rejection. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>Secondly, as far as Ali Mazrui is concerned, what is
constant is that the intellectual loyalty is not a devotion nor a submission.
The intellectual loyalty is always dialectical and emancipatory. In this
framework, it is a recognition of the richness of his intellectual
achievements. In fact, if political science in Africa is considered as a normal
science, in the sense of Thomas Kuhn, it is because it has authors that have
established paradigms to understand and explain reality. Ali Mazrui is one of
those authors. He made substantial contributions in different domains: for
instance, in comparative politics through his attempt to elaborate ideal types
of leadership in independent Africa; in International Relations through his
elaboration on the pertinence of the cultural variable or the pax Africana. His
work is structured by a permanent proliferation of concepts and ideas. In the
same vein, other African political science scholars can be mentioned such as
Dan Nabudere, Claude Ake, Okwudiba Nnoli, Samir Amin, Adele Jinadu, etc. At
this stage, it should be recognized that the analysis made in the 1990s by
Thandeka Mkandawire on the different generations of African social science
scholars is relevant to apprehend the institutionalization of political science
in Africa and its incarnation by some scholars (Mkandawire, 1995).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>Twenty years ago, I was introducing in Pretoria a conference
presented by Ali Mazrui. Today, I am delivering in Pretoria the “Ali Mazrui
Memorial Lecture”. What a coincidence! Pretoria is a city where I met with Ali
Mazrui. The first time, I met him in person, body and spirit. Today, I am
meeting him in spirit, in order to engage a discussion on his works. Therefore,
I am particularly moved. However, as legitimate as it can be, emotion is not a
category of thought. That is why reason is needed <span style='font-size:12.5pt;

password to get access to the intellectual universe of Ali Mazrui’s works.
These works are so rich and diverse that, used as password, reason requires
that I select a concept for the purpose of my analysis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'> I have chosen deliberately to organize my “Ali Mazrui
Memorial Lecture” around the idea of culture as summoned by Ali Mazrui, in its
implications in international relations.  My choice is partial because it hides
other dimensions of Ali Mazrui’s works. I do not pretend to be a specialist of
Ali Mazrui’s works. I do confess that I am just an opportunistic user of his
works. Without ignoring the richness and the complexity of Ali Mazrui works, my
focus is on his operationalization of culture in international politics. My
approach ignores the logic of antipodes whose terms are “Mazruiphilia” and
“Mazruiphobia” as described by <span style='color:#333333'>Ndlovu-Gatsheni
(2015, 205-222). The </span>“Mazruiphilia” and “Mazruiphobia” quarrel has no
place in a science where the logic of discovery repudiates primary feelings.
Worshiping and abhorring are not scientific attitudes. Ali Mazrui’s works are
scientific works only if their eventual falsifiability, in Popperian sense, are
dedramatized and banalized. That is my epistemological standing point while
using Ali Mazrui’s stimulating ideas on the relation between culture and
politics.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>It is through the lenses of culture that Ali Mazrui analyzes
the state with the paradigm of the triple heritage: Islamic, Christian and
Indigenous. That paradigm is fruitful even if one must insist that the
influence of heritage is not mechanic: political actors elsewhere in Africa
have always reinterpreted or instrumentalized cultural heritage. Moreover,
there should be more nuance in the use of the triple heritage idea. Because
there are other factors that are relevant such as economics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>Culture is used by Ali Mazrui in his analysis of
international relations. Here, we must notice the anteriority of his works on
those of Samuel Huntington about the role of cultural factors in world
politics. The title of the third Reith Lecture delivered by Ali Mazrui on
November, 21, 1979 was “A clash of cultures”, nearly two decades before the
publication by Samuel Huntington’s “The clash of civilizations”. The arguments
of those two authors are different, even if they have in common, the absolutism
of the cultural paradigm, the primacy of culture and the explanation of the
cleavage between the “west” and the “non west world”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>It is in the post-cold war era that the cultural paradigm
has become more visible in the mainstream political science (Huntington, 1996):
in all the domains, it is considered that “culture counts” (Huntington, 2000:
13-16). Culture was then given a <span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:
102%'>droit de cité</span> (place to be) in mainstream political science and
was no longer treated with disdain. In 1976, in his major book <span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>A world Federation of Cultures: an
African perspective, </span>Ali Mazrui had proposed a solution for a desirable
international order, a world federation of cultures (Mazrui, 1976). He had
exposed the importance of cultural factors in international relations due to
the functions of culture (as a worldview, a source of identity, a basis of
stratification, an instrument of communication, a standard of judgment, a
source of motivation, a system of production and consumption) (Mazrui, 1990).
The success of the ideas of Samuel Huntington, despite the explanatory poverty
of some of them, had been a factor for the rediscovery of the pertinence of those
of Ali Mazrui about the cultural cleavages, the subversion of the
westernization of the world, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>In this memorial lecture, from my privileged position on the
shoulders of the intellectual giant that is Ali Mazrui, I intend to
operationalize the cultural paradigm in international relations through the
category of cultural international order. I do not share Ali Mazrui’s
advocation of the primacy of culture; he considers that culture is the cause
and economy, the consequence. In fact, the “embeddedness” of culture, economy
and politics is an obstacle to the absolute separation of one from the others.
Having in mind the reality of interpenetration, the separation can only be
artificial and relative. Any attempt to establish a rigid hierarchy among
cultures, politics and economics is bound to fail.  While culture influences
economy, in return economy influences culture: the relation is bijective. Here,
the debate on the roles of “chicken” and “egg” is useless. What matters, is the
scientific proposition to account for a cultural international order. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>The cultural international order is a partial dimension of
the international order. Like the political international order or the economic
international order, it is more constructed than given. By cultural
international order, I refer to the systems of beliefs, representations, laws,
customs, discourses, and myths that are part of the power distribution in the
world, that structure the interaction among states and non-state actors of
international relations. There is an umbilical relation between the international
order and culture (Linklater and Suganami, 2006). The two main hypotheses of
the English school of International Relations underline the relationship
between “pattern of cultures” and “society of states”: the first hypothesis is
that “a shared culture is a precondition for the formation of a society of
states”; the second one is that “a society of states lacking a shared culture
because it has expanded beyond its original base will be unstable” (Buzan,
2010: 1). Even the realist school is permeated by the culture variable, despite
its pretention to provide a value free explanation of world politics: the
anarchy that we know, be it “mature” or “immature”, is made by the states with
societal values, beliefs, patterns of behavior, customs and laws (Kissinger,
2014; Wendt, 1992: 391-425).   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>In my line of reasoning, an international order implies <span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>a minima (minimum)</span> of
plurality of members and an interaction among its members in their respective
positions: each member is influenced by its culture; the interaction among
members is an opportunity for the flow of cultures, ideas, images, sounds that
transcend boundaries, that can lead to acceptation, imitation, reinterpretation
or rejection, clash or concord (depending on the way in which they are
mobilized). Moreover, the interaction among the members is determined by a
complex of rules, norms, habits, and institutions, commonly established, or
universally imposed by some “established” actors to outsiders or newcomers.
Culture is a factor of institutionalization of order, just like order produces
culture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>The cultural international order that I am referring to, is
not necessarily just or equitable. It is a regular, predictable and stable
pattern of interaction among states and other actors, based on agreed,
respected or dominant norms, rules, institutions. The cultural international
order is fundamentally subjective because it has to do with values, beliefs,
standard of judgement and “frame of experience”. It is a terrain of
manifestation of, on one part, the will of some actors to impose their
arbitrary cultural as a universal norm versus the claim of the cultural
selfdetermination of other actors, on the other part, the permanent negotiation
of common norms. The historic context that I will analyze starts from the 19<sup>th</sup>
century till contemporary times. It is a context characterized by the western
claim of the monopoly for structuring the cultural international order
(Wallerstein, 2006). </p>

Stability is not synonymous of immobilism.  Consequently, referring to the
Norbert Elias’ theory of configuration (Elias, 1993: 155-159) is useful to
present the different figures of cultural international order. The “global
figure” constituted by the actors, evolves according to the “equilibrium of

vertical and horizontal. </p>

hierarchy characterized by power politics. It is a particular order that
“universalizes” itself (Leclerc, 2000). The idea of the cultural international
order as <span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>the fake nose</span>
(sock puppet) of western cultural order is presented in the works of Ali Mazrui
in different manners. </p>

international order is in fact a manifestation of western cultural supremacy
made possible by European imperialism, the colonization of the non-western
world among which is Africa. The western supremacy is so strong that the
colonization of non-western societies in Asia and Africa is presented as the
expansion of international relations whose rules and principles were defined by
western states according to their culture and history. As Ali Mazrui expresses
it: <span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>“There is a sense in which
the West regards an interpretation of the march of history as having one
destination and that is towards the evolution of institutions that are very
western…all those three- westernization, modernization and globalization- are interrelated
and they assume a single direction of the march of history…”. </span> What is
at work is the production of a rigid hierarchy of cultures having at the top,
as Ali Mazrui puts it beautifully, the west as the “role model”. The idea of a
specific culture being a role model for other cultures carries the ideology of
the “role model culture” as the procrustean bed into which the non-western
cultures should be constrained to lay on.  </p>

international order was built without and against Africa. According to Ali
Mazrui, the position of Africa is at the down of the hierarchy: Africa’s
identity is being defined by European languages as demonstrate by the
expressions “French speaking Africa”, “English speaking Africa”, or “Portuguese
speaking Africa”. The cultural extraversion towards the western cultures is so
strong that Ali Mazrui proposed that, despite the humiliation of slavery and
colonization, Africa is the most westernized continent. The African condition
is shared to some extent by the Arabs and the Islamic world. </p>

margin-left:36.9pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The cultural
international order pretends to be universal, to have, in Ali Mazrui terms,
“the status of universal validity” in the context of globalization.  Ali Mazrui
uses two terms to analyze the western claim of universalism: Homogenization and
hegemonization. Both are part of the <span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:
102%'>pax americana</span>. Homogenization refers to the increasing production
of similarity with the west as a referential point. Its perimeter includes the
globalization of European languages, the progressive convergence of educational
systems, the triumph of market economy, the interdependence of societies and so
on. Meanwhile, the sister process called hegemonization is made of the
orchestration and enforcement of “marketization, liberalization and
privatization” by “western economic gurus, the positioning of American and
European educational systems as the role models of the educational convergence,
the globalization of western dress, the control of the world economy by western
countries, the location in US of the nerve centre of the global internet
system” and so on. The processes of homogenization and hegemonization tend to
impose a universal cultural order dictated by western states. Those processes
are real. But, Ali Mazrui had absolutized their effects due to the illusion of
similarity: the globalization of western languages, western dress and even
western sounds does not preclude their local reinventions and appropriations.
To this effect, the Nigerian cultural landscape is an interesting site of
observation of the subversion of western cultural influences. For instance, the
use of English language by Nigerian writers is more specific than “universal”.
Likewise, hegemonization does not mean total control. Hegemons always encounter
resistances and can be weaken by the undesired effects of power’s concentration.
As colorfully depicted by Stanley Hoffman, Gulliver can face troubles and be
entangled (1968). The “unipolar moment” is more an ideal type than a reality. </p>

existence of an order. As it is the case with cultural international order, an
order can also be horizontal. The idea of horizontal cultural order is
intrinsic in the works of Ali Mazrui. Here, it is borrowed from public policy
where the concept of horizontal governance is often used.  Horizonal governance
is in contradiction with hierarchical or vertical governance. It is based on
collaboration, coordination, shared responsibilities or power sharing for decisions
and outcomes. Horizontal governance is defined by some main characteristics: -
nonhierarchical structures; - partnership versus competition; - coordination
(Peters, 1998). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;

limits such as the dilution of responsibility. I do not create a dichotomy

can be balanced, semi vertical and semi horizontal, according to the
conjuncture and the goals.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:7.5pt;

the vertical one. They are two distinct and complimentary regimes of
interiorization and exteriorization of order. Even better, they are part of the
same continuum of values, habits, beliefs, and pattern of behavior that creates
stability, regularity, predictability and mutual recognition in the interaction
among states. However, horizontal cultural international order is specific. It
develops more on the logic of collective deliberation than imposition. It has
more to do with common culture than national cultures. There are similarities
between horizontal cultural international order and the international society
as elaborated by the English school of international relations. </p>

cultural international order is promoted by international organizations. It is
a consequence of multilateralism when states take advantage of their membership
in various organizations to establish common norms, rules, organs and
institutions that are supposed to govern their behavior in the international
milieu in different domains. Through universal and regional organizations,
horizontal cultural international order is institutionalized.  </p>

cultural international order should not be idealized. Various international
organizations were created when international society was restricted to Europe
and major powers like USA, China and the then Soviet Union. The
universalization of those organizations had not always coincided with power
redistribution. Therefore, the inequality among states in international
organizations affects the validity of horizontal cultural international order
(Smouts, 1995: 259-271). It is the belief in the legitimacy and the necessity
of a genuine inclusive international cultural order that justifies the claim
for the reform of United Nations and the global financial architecture. </p>

decolonization of Africa and Asia remains the source of the crisis of the
cultural international order. In an order that was structured around European
and western values, to deal with other cultures and conceptions of life is
necessarily dysfunctional. For instance, in the United Nations, before the
proliferation of African states, the General Assembly was the place <span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>par excellence</span> where important
resolutions were adopted. What is more normal: the balance of forces at the
general assembly was in favor of western states. After the decolonization, the
western states lost their numerical power. And African states, thanks to their
majority, gained the control of the agenda and engaged discussions on the new
political world order, the new economic world order, the new cultural and
informational world order. The period between the 1960s and 1980s is
characterized by a systematic critique of western norms and values. In that
context, western states used the United Nations charter in order to
marginalized the General Assembly and to remind that the Security Council is
the center of gravity: the same states were using the powers of the General
Assembly in the 1950s to neutralize Russia and champion their values and norms.
What is at stake is the control of norms and values that influence peace and
security in the world. Despite the attempts to marginalize the General Assembly
of United Nations, it has remained an important organ and tribune where third
world countries denounce the arbitrary cultures of western countries. </p>

cultural international order is also reflected by the “exit” dimension of the
strategy of third world countries. The African-Asian conference held in Bandung
(Indonesia) from 18<sup>th</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> April 1955 is one clear
illustration. The principle of the Bandung conference was a challenge of the
western supremacy by ex-colonized countries. The Bandung conference of 1955 was
based on an unsatisfaction with the world order as it is and the culture that
goes with. Therefore, it was aiming at a sub or counter cultural international
order suitable to “the problems of common interest and concern of countries of
Asia and Africa”. The exit from the existing cultural international order was
not complete. While they were positioning themselves as normative engineers
through the emphasis on the principles of <span style='color:#040B28'>political
self-determination, mutual respect for sovereignty, non-aggression,
non-interference in internal affairs, and equality, states participating in the
Bandung conference were laying down conditions of their participation in the
international cultural order. That mixture of variance and deviance is also at
work in the Non-Aligned Movement. Here, the challenge of the cultural
international order is originally structured around the condemnation of
imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism. Based on Bandung principles, The
Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, during the Cairo summit, was calling for a
transition from an “old world based on domination to a new world based on
cooperation between nations, founded on freedom, equality, and social justice
for the promotion of prosperity”.</span> </p>

the cultural international order is to a large extent a product of third world
critique of the “western” pretense to monopolize identification with
“Provincializing” Europe (Chakrabarty, 2000) as it is done by decolonization
and globalization: the move from a Eurocentric order to a universal one is
necessarily a crisis. A crisis that had started in the twentieth century and is

order. Indeed, the cultural diversity of the world is a factor of
disintegration of that order.  For this purpose, the UNESCO  2005 Convention on
the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is
meaningful: It affirms cultural diversity “as a defining characteristic of
humanity”; it recognizes the necessity to promote and protect the diversity of
cultural expressions; it emphasizes on the principle of equal dignity and
respect for all cultures.  Consequently, heterogeneity became a category of
perception of cultural international order. Likewise, pluriversality is also to
be taken into consideration (Parasram, 2023: 356-367). The insistence on
heterogeneity and “pluriversality” is the result of the crystallization of the
figure of the multiple.   Having said that, homogeneity and universality, on
the one hand can cohabit with heterogeneity and pluriversality, on another
hand. Such cohabitation is part of the paradigmatic change that occurs in

margin-left:.15pt'>On what concerns the crisis of the cultural international
order, Ali Mazrui’s works were adding fuel to the fire. Being a fierce critique
of the western hegemony, he was also the architect on an alliance between Arabs
and Africa in order to create a new world order. That imagined alliance was
baptized “Afrabia” and presented as “part of the answer” to the risk of “a
disproportionated number of more dead muslims” and “a disproportionated number
of more poor blacks” created by the world order (Mazrui, 1992: 60). “Historical
fusion of Arabism and Africanity…”, according to Ali Mazrui, Afrabia will link
“languages, religions, and identities across both the Sahara Desert and the Red
Sea” (Mazrui, 1992:  62). Here, prophetism seems to have entangled the scientific
analysis. As evidence, the conclusive sentence of the Ali Mazrui’s paper is
“Amen” (Mazrui; 1992: 62). Even if it seems to be a prayer, it remains that in
that prayer, Ali Mazrui is criticizing strongly the world order dominated by
westerns states. He is praying for an alternative cultural international order
built around Africans and Arabs. Prophets are not generally welcome in social
sciences. Because they are more inclined to value judgements than to factual
ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:18.75pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>The reinvention of cultural international order had been
permanent in the works of Ali Mazrui. He had always had an idea of a desirable
world order. His participation in the “World Order Models Project” had led to a
major proposal of a World Federation of Cultures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:5.1pt;
margin-left:36.9pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A desirable
cultural international order, according to Ali Mazrui, should be organized
through the world federation of cultures. The cultural federation is formed of
pluralistic and complimentary cultures. It is a factor of peace in the world.
In that regards, Ali Mazrui proposes three main principles: - the acceptance of
cultural interdependence among constituent parts; - the acceptance of the
principle of parity of esteem among constituent parts; - the promotion of
“cultural fusion” at the federal level. It is interesting to note that Ali
Mazrui applied the concept of federation to cultures and not states. That is
his main difference with Emmanuel Kant who had also mustered the concept of
federation in order to achieve “perpetual peace” in international relations
(Kant, 1991). Contrary to Emmanuel Kant who was suggesting that the “federative
union” should be among states, Ali Mazrui had based the world federation on
cultures. At this level, Ali Mazrui is more closed to Samuel Huntington: while
Ali Mazrui in 1976 considered cultures as actors of international relations,
Samuel Huntington analyzed in 1993 civilizations as actors of international
relations. Such concealment or minimization of states weakens Ali Mazrui’s idea
of world federation of cultures. Cultures exist independently from states. But
cultures by themselves don’t make war nor peace.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:36.9pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The idea of
“fusion of cultures” proposed by Ali Mazrui is to some extent similar to the
one of “civilisation de l’universel” (civilization of the universal) championed
by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The <span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>civilisation
de l’universel</span>, as exposed by the Senegalese poet President Léopold
Sédar Senghor, is a synthesis between the African and European civilizations.
The interpenetration of civilizations is a sort of “cultural fusion”. The
rapprochement between Ali Mazrui and Léopold Sédar Senghor is normal. Ali
Mazrui was interested by the literature of Négritude. For instance, he had
referred to the Martinican poet, Aimé Césaire in his critique of the European
arrogance (Mazrui, 2003). The ideas of fusion of cultures and of <span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>civilisation de l’universel </span>are
quite interesting. In one dimension, they rejoin the reality because there’s no
pure culture. The cultural landscape had always been characterized everywhere
by imitation, emulation, borrowing and loss in such a way that a culture
supposed to be pure is in fact more mix and hybrid than it might appear. In
another dimension, the ideas of Ali Mazrui and Leopold Sédar Senghor are naïve
to some extent: the <span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'>civilisation
de l’universel </span>is supposed to be rendez-vous of give and take, of parity
of cultures; but it can be observed that some cultures give more than they
take, others take more than they give. It is the same with the fusion of
cultures due to the fact that here balance of forces matter. The fusion does
not hide or suppress the imperialist tendencies of some cultures in such a way
that the so-called hybridity is in fact and annexation of other cultures
(Sindjoun, 2002).<span style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:102%'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.1pt;margin-bottom:13.9pt;
margin-left:.15pt'>The problem of cultural international order, as analyzed
through the works of Ali Mazrui, reveals the dialectics of stability and
change, homogeneity and heterogeneity, universality and “pluriversality”. In
fact, it invites to the use of a grammar of multiplicity. At this stage, the
heuristic fertility of the figure of Babel (that is familiar to Ali Mazrui)
leads to the proposal of a dynamic continuum formed by one soft international
cultural order and multiple international cultural orders. </p>
