resulted in some of the most vulnerable societies in modern world history. </p>

.25pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>German unification at the end of the
20th century was almost a celebration of the centenary of Otto von Bismarck’s
final years as effective leader of the German Empire. Three European wars in
the nineteenth century had helped German unification. These were Germany’s war
with Denmark in 1864; with Austria in 1866 and with France in 1871. Bismarck
led the Germans in war and peace in this period—and he was made <i>Prince</i>
Von Bismarck on March 21, 1871. He was appointed Chancellor of the German </p>

the Western world is Barack Obama— more by virtue of the power of the United
States than as a result of his own sustained personal performance in world
affairs for the time being. Out of the juxtaposition of Bismarck with Obama a
number of historical dialectics emerge, a number of political paradoxes. Obama
is partly a descendant of the Africa which Bismarck had helped to partition. </p>

have been in the <i>capitalist</i> game for a century, they have been
relatively marginal as old-style <i>colonial</i> powers. Neither country built
a large territorial colonial empire. The United States limited itself to the
Philippines and a few islands as colonial possessions. Germany had a larger
territorial appetite than the United States, but did not succeed in keeping its
colonies for long. </p>

as colonial powers. Nevertheless, within the same period, Germany and the
United States have often approximated the status of capitalist <i>giants</i>.
That the two countries could be giants as capitalists and dwarfs as
colonialists casts at least partial doubt on too easy a co-relation between
capitalism and colonialism within the old Leninist paradigm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.45pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>            The second dialectic concerning Germany
and the United States is connected with the fact that Bismarck hosted a
conference which officially launched the partition of Africa. The United
States, on the other hand, produced citizens who launched the ideology of the
unity of Africa. Bismarck hosted that Berlin conference of 1884–1885 which
brought together some sixteen Western powers. These states negotiated the
ground rules for the European scramble for Africa. The United States was
present at the Berlin conference but did not compete for African territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.45pt;margin-bottom:

W.E.B. DuBois was born in February 1869 in Massachusetts. Before the end of the
nineteenth century he was active in the organization of what became the first
Pan-African Congress of 1900. Bismarck had played midwife to the partition of
Africa. DuBois was to play midwife to the ideology of African unification. Yet
divided Africa nevertheless managed to father a Black President of the United
States, Barack Obama, with potential credentials for helping Africa to
transcend its fragmentation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.45pt;margin-bottom:

himself, the man who unified Germany and helped to divide Africa. Even in the

declared a hundred years earlier (in 1889) “I am not a colonial man.” And yet
for a while he succeeded in bringing Germany closer to the role of a colonial
power in Africa than any other figure in history. In the 1880s Bismarck managed
to get control of Cameroons, Tanganyika, Rwanda, Burundi, part of New Guinea,
as well as South West Africa (now Namibia). </p>

this joint success, by Nujoma, Mandela and Obama, lies in their embodying a
short memory of racial hate, and in their impressive readiness to forgive
historic adversaries. They have all illustrated a capacity to transcend
historic racial divides. </p>

produced five styles of political leadership. A <i>charismatic</i> leadership
style depends mainly on the personal magnetism of the leader— and is best
illustrated by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and indeed Obama and Martin Luther King,
Jr. <i>Mobilizational</i> style uses ideology and party organization to
mobilize the masses, and is best illustrated by Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania
and indeed Obama’s mobilization of young Americans. The <i>Managerial</i> style
uses skills of management and technocratic pragmatism, and this is illustrated
by the second South African president, Thabo Mbeki and Felix Houphouet-Boigny
of the Ivory Coast, who died in 1993. A <i>Coercive</i> style of political
leadership relies mainly on a regime of fear and demands for compliance and
obedience. Most military regimes have been coercive in that sense, perhaps best
illustrated by Idi Amin of Uganda. However, there have also been civilian
regimes of coercion and fear—like that of Hastings Banda of Malawi and Sekou
Touré of Guinea (Conakry). The apartheid model was also coercive. </p>

was released from prison in 1990, there is a temptation to think of Mandela
primarily as an example of conciliatory leadership. But, in fact, the younger
Mandela was a powerful combination of charisma and mobilization—rather than a
conciliatory leader. Is such charismatic conciliation also characteristic of
Obama? Mandela’s personal magnetism enabled him to rise rapidly in the African
National Congress Youth League (NACYL). In 1952, he was elected National
Volunteer-Chief and proceeded to traverse the country—trying to organize
resistance as part of the ANC Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws. Because
of his role in the Defiance Campaign, he was accused of violating the
Suppression of Communism Act. He was convicted, but his record of strict
non-violence at that stage earned him a suspended sentence and a confinement
within the boundaries of the city of Johannesburg. Much later, Barack Obama was
accused of Black American extremism and was even suspected of being a closet
Muslim. But he was not tried in court! </p>

Laureate). The ANC’s Programme of Action was inspired by the Youth League and
envisaged a struggle based on civil disobedience, labour strikes and
non-cooperation. Mandela was heavily involved in much of the planning, the
organization and the implementation of such methods of struggle. In
anticipation of the possible banning of the ANC, Mandela accepted the awesome
responsibility of preparing a master-plan for underground networking and secret
lines of communication. But, in most of the 1950’s, Nelson Mandela, as a
mobilization leader, was averse to violence. He also helped to promote the <i>Freedom
Charter</i> which had been adopted by the Congress of the People in 1955. </p>

African National Congress, after a long and agonizing reappraisal, reached the
conclusion that violence could no longer be ruled out against a coercive regime
of racial intolerance. It was in the same year, 1961, that the <i>Umkhonto we

Commander-in-Chief. Mandela, as a charismatic leader, was now involved in <i>armed</i>
mobilization. </p>

fortress-cage on Robben Island, he continued to reaffirm the legitimacy of
armed struggle. Later he was transferred to a less isolated prison in Cape Town
[Pollsmor and Victor Vester prisons]. The apartheid regime offered him
remission of sentence in exchange for renouncing violence. He turned the offer
down.   And, yet, when he was finally released, in February 1990, this most
illustrious of all Africa’s liberation fighters embarked on a mission of
healing and forgiving. This former hero of mobilization leadership became a
paragon of the reconciliation style. Mandela became the greatest of all African
