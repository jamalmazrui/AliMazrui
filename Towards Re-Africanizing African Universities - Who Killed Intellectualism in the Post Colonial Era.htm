years.  Under the previous political order a lecture by Mazrui at the
University of Nairobi needed the permission not just of the Vice Chancellor but
also of the Office of the Head of State.  I hope that under the new
dispensation all that was needed to invite me to give this lecture was the
decision of the relevant department. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The last time I lectured in Taifa Hall was about ten years
ago when Kenyan alumni of the U.S. Fulbright-Scheme were celebrating the 50<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of Fulbright and wanted me as their keynote speaker.  My topic was
relatively innocuous – “African Universities and the American Model of Higher
Education.”  Even such a lecture needed the permission of the Office of the
Head of State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Let me begin with a crucial question.  How can a
university help to develop the society to which it belongs?  In reality no
university is ever able to help develop a society unless the society is first
ready to help develop the university.  It is a symbiotic relationship.  A
society without the will to create a sustainable university is a society
without the will to maintain sustainable development.  A fundamental starting
point is a readiness by the society to award a university a  charter which
guarantees institutional independence and also guarantees the members academic
freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Behind it all is the whole tradition of intellectualism. 
People can be very <u>intelligent</u> without being actively <u>intellectual</u>. 
Intellectualism is an engagement in the realm of ideas and rational enquiry. 
In the years since independence what has been the fate of intellectualism in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.7pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.45pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:198%'> Over the last forty years East Africa
has experienced the rise and decline of African intellectuals.  What is an
intellectual?  <u>An intellectual is a person who has the capacity to be</u> <u>fascinated
by ideas, and has acquired the skill to handle some of them effectively.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> When I was an academic at the University of  East Africa
in the early years of independence my colleagues consisted substantially of
people who were capable of being fascinated by ideas.  Every week there was a
range of extra-curricular events on campus.  Public lectures at the Makerere
campus or at the University of Nairobi were often heavily attended.  In the
case of my own evening lectures at both Makerere and Nairobi, students
sometimes gave up their suppers in order to get a seat at one of my presentations. 
The main halls were packed to overflowing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> For its Head of State Kenya had the nation’s first black
social anthropologist, Jomo Kenyatta – author of <u>Facing Mt. Kenya</u>. 
Uganda had for Head of Government a person who had changed his name because of
admiration of the author of the great English poem, <u>Paradise</u> <u>Lost</u>. 
Obote became Milton Obote out of admiration of John Milton. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The most intellectual of East Africa’s Heads of State at
the time was Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania – a true philosopher, president and
original thinker.  He philosophized about society and socialism, and translated
two of Shakespeare’s plays into Kiswahili – <u>Julius</u> <u>Caesar</u> and <u>The
Merchant of Venice</u>.  The Swahili translations were published by Oxford
University Press – beginning in 1963, the year of Kenya’s independence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> East Africa had vivacious and scintillating intellectual
magazines – such as <u>Transition</u> magazine based in Kampala and <u>East
Africa Journal</u> based in Nairobi.  Contributors to those magazines were
intellectuals from the campuses, from the wider civil society and from the
governing class.  The late Tom Mboya of Kenya, one of the most brilliant East
Africans of his time, wrote for those magazines from time to time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Those were the days when it was possible for me to be
engaged in a public disagreement with a Head of State, Milton Obobe, and
survive.  It was also possible for a public debate to occur in the Town Hall of
Kampala between a professor of political science </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>(myself) and the Head of  Intelligence in Uganda’s Security
system (Mr. Akena Adoko).  Mr. Adoko was at the time the second most powerful
civilian  in Uganda after the Head of State.  The campuses vibrated with
debates about fundamental issues of the day – </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>nationalism, socialism, democracy and the party system, and
the role of intellectuals in what was widely designated as “the African
revolution”.  Since then, w<u>ho has killed intellectualism</u> <u>in East
Africa?</u>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In Uganda part of the answer is obvious. 
A military coup occurred in January 1971, which brought Idi Amin into power. 
Eight years of brutal dictatorship followed.  No less a person than the
Vice-Chancellor of Makerere – Frank Kalimuzo – was abducted in broad daylight
from the campus and never heard of again.  A similar fate befell the judicially
courageous Chief Justice of Uganda, Benedicto Kiwanuka.  The scintillating
intellectual voices of Uganda either fell silent or went into exile.  Before
long I too packed my bags and left my beloved Makerere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> <u>Who killed intellectualism in Kenya?</u>  The killers
included rising authoritarianism in government and declining academic freedom
on campuses.  The very fact that the University of Nairobi was unable to hire
me when I resigned from Makerere was a measure of the impact of political
authoritarianism on the university’s freedom of choice.  These were the
mid-1970s when Kenyatta was still in power.  The fate of intellectualism became
worse and worse during the years of President Daniel arap Moi. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> If the first two killers of intellectualism in Kenya were
rising political authoritarianism and declining academic freedom, the third
killer was the Cold War between Western powers and the Soviet bloc.  The
government of Kenya was co-opted into the Western camp, sometimes at the
expense of Kenya’s own citizens.  Being socialist or left-wing as an
intellectual became a  political hazard.  All sorts of laws and edicts emerged
about subversive literature.  Possessing the works of Mao Tse Tung of the People’s
Republic of China was a crime in Kenya, and people actually went to jail for
it.  My own nephew, Dr. Alamin M. Mazrui of Kenyatta University, was detained
without charge by the Moi regime for more than a year for being a left-wing
Kenyan academic in the company of such other left-wingers as Ngugi wa Thiong’o
and Micere Mugo. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Intellectual opposition to capitalism in Kenya became
increasingly a punishable offense.  Lives of socialists were sometimes in
danger.  Like the life of the relatively powerless Pinto, who was assassinated.
Moderately left-wing political leaders like Oginga Odinga were ostracized.  All
these were forces which were murderous of intellectualism in Kenya. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Who killed intellectualism in Tanzania? In Tanzania
intellectualism was slow to die.  It was partially protected by the fact that
the Head of State – Julius Nyerere – was himself a superb intellectual ruler. 
He was not only fascinated by ideas, but also stimulated by debates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But two factors in Tanzania had paradoxical roles – the
ideology of <u>Ujamaa</u> (Tanzania’s version of socialism) and Nyerere’s
one-party system.  On the one hand, <u>Ujamaa</u> and the justification of the
one-party state stimulated a considerable amount of intellectual
rationalization and conceptualization.  On the other hand, there was no
escaping the fact that one-partyism was a discriminatory system of government
and the enthusiasm for socialism in Tanzania intimidated those who were against
it.  I visited the campus of the University of Dar es Salaam many times and I
witnessed some of the consequences of ideological intimidation in the name of
socialism.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> What this means is that while in Kenya intellectualism
died partly because of the Cold War opposition to socialism, in Tanzania
intellectualism died partly because of excessive local enthusiasm <u>for</u>
socialism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>                   In my own personal life I was respected
more as an intellectual by Milton Obole in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Uganda and Julius Nyerere in Tanzania than I was by either
Mzee Kenyatta or Daniel arap Moi in Kenya.  Even Idi Amin, when he was in power
in Uganda, wanted to send me to apartheid South Africa as living proof that
Africans could <u>think</u>.  Idi Amin wanted me to become <u>Exhibit A of the
Black Intellectual</u> to convince racists in South Africa that Black people
were human beings capable of rational thought.  Fortunately, I was able to
convince Idi Amin, not humour racists, with such a display. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But apart from ensuring a climate of academic freedom and
the free flourishing of intellectualism, what does society have to do to
develop a university before the university becomes capable of helping to
develop society?  Clearly resources are crucial.  The society has to be ready
to invest resources in the university great enough to ensure high quality of
academic recruitment and high quality of academic retention of staff and
students. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Resources will also be needed for high quality curriculum
development and high quality research and general development.  Students and
staff are human beings whose motivation and sense of commitment needs to be
sustained by a system of rewards and recognition.  Grades for students should
be a true measure of achievement; so should promotions for staff.  Promotions
without performance should come to an end if the spirit of intellectual
ambition is to be restored. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But no university can be a first class institution of
higher learning if the secondary schools which feed into it are all mediocre. 
In order to fully develop a university, society also has to develop the
educational ladder as a whole.  Quality of education at the primary and
secondary levels needs to be sustained if the final candidates for possible
admission to the universities are to be of high standard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The capacity to be curious and fascinated by ideas has to
start early in the educational process.  The spirit of intellectualism has to
be nourished from primary school onwards, but it can die at the university
level if mediocrity prevails. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In relation to the wider world, a university has three
crucial relationships.  A university has to be <u>politically distant</u> from
the state; secondly, a university has also to be <u>culturally close</u> to
society; and thirdly, a university has to be intellectually linked to wider
scholarly and scientific values of the world of learning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Can a university be funded by the state and still maintain
political distance?  It has been done in other societies; there is no reason
why it cannot happen in Africa as well.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>British universities still depend heavily
on the state, even when they have large endowments.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'>This is a common pattern in Europe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In the United States, government-funded universities are
funded mainly at the state level rather than federal level.  Nevertheless, the
Federal Government contributes billions to higher education generally without
compromising academic freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In Kenya, President Mwai Kibaki’s administration may have
started the process of depoliticizing the public universities by a new
atmosphere of academic autonomy.  The President’s decision to give up the
Chancellorships of the six public universities is an important symbol of
decentralization and depoliticization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In addition to political distance from the
state, each university needs to be culturally close to society.  This is a much
tougher proposition in Africa, especially since African university systems are
colonial in origin and disproportionately European in traditions.  African
universities are among the major instruments and vehicles of cultural
westernization on the continent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> A contradiction occurs between the university’s duty to be
culturally close to its society and the university ambition to be
intellectually linked to the wider world of scholarship and science. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In this connection it is worth bearing in mind important
differences between the westernization of Africa and the modernization of Japan
after the Meiji Restoration of 1868.  Japan’s original modernization involved
considerable selectivity on the part of the Japanese themselves (“Western
Technique, Japanese Spirit”).  The whole purpose of selective Japanese
westernization was to protect Japan against the West, rather than merely to
submit to western cultural attractions.  The emphasis in Japan was therefore on
the technical and technological techniques of the West, rather than on literary
and verbal culture.   The Japanese slogan of “western technique, Japanese
spirit” at the time captured this ambition to borrow technology from the West
while deliberately protecting a substantial part of Japanese culture.  In a
sense, Japan’s technological westernization was designed to reduce the danger
of other forms of cultural dependency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The nature of westernization in Africa has been very
different.  Far from emphasizing western productive technology and reducing
western life-styles and verbal culture, Africa has reversed the Japanese order
of emphasis.  Among the factors which have facilitated this reversal has been
the role of the African university as a vehicle of western culture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;

borrowed a leaf from the Japanese book of cultural </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>selection, and initially concentrated on what is
indisputably the West’s real area of leadership and marginal advantage (science
and technology), the resultant African dependency might have been of a
different kind.  But the initial problem lay precisely in the model of the
university itself – the paradigm of academia, with its distrust of direct
problem-solving in the wider society.  “There is much in our education system
(in Britain) which makes it easier to define problems in terms of narrowly
scientific objectives.  The existing relationship between universities (with
the unidirectional flow of ‘experts’ and advisors, the flow of overseas
students to this country, etc.) have tended to transfer the same standards and
expectations to the LDCs [Less Developed Countries] ……  Technologies for the
satisfaction of basic needs and for rural development have received little
attention…..  curricula, text books and teaching methods are too closely
imitative of practice in industrialized countries.  This has spilled over from
teaching into research expectations.  Universities have aimed to achieve
international standards in defining the criteria for staff recognition and
promotion; in practice this means using the international scientific and
engineering literature as the touchstone.  However, applied work directed at
the solution of local problems…..can rarely be associated with publication in
‘respectable’ journals:  a far better test is the local one of success or
failure of the particular project in the LDC environment.”<sup>1</sup>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The one paradigmatic change which was necessary for the
imported universities did not in fact occur.  The missing factor was a change
in the conception of the university itself and what its purposes were.  The new
Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya – strongly
supported by the Japanese – may explore new developmental horizons in tertiary
education. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The original colonial university was so uncompromisingly
foreign in an African context, and was transplanted with few concessions to
African cultures, its impact was more culturally alienating than it need have
been.  A whole generation of African graduates grew up despising their own
ancestry, and scrambling to imitate the West. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Those early African graduates who have
later become university teachers themselves have on the whole remained
intellectual imitators and disciples of the West.  African <u>historians</u>
have since begun to innovate methodologically as they have grappled with oral
traditions, but most of the other disciplines are still condemned to
paradigmatic dependency.  African universities rely overwhelmingly on European
languages as media of instruction.  On the one hand, European languages
complicate any effort to take African universities culturally closer to African
societies.  On the other hand, those European languages help African
universities in the search for intellectual links to the wider world of
scholarship and science.  Let us look more closely at this dilemma between the
quest for cultural authenticity and the necessity of using the imperial
languages inherited from the colonial era. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> An important source of Africa’s intellectual dependency is
the language in which African graduates and scholars are taught.  For the time
being it is impossible for an African to be even moderately familiar with the
works of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx without the help of a European language. 
Neither <u>The Origin of Species</u> nor <u>Das Kapital</u> is as yet available
in Hausa or Kiswahili, let alone in Kidigo or Lutoro.  Parts of the <u>Manifesto
of the</u> <u>Communist Party</u> have already been translated into Kiswahili
and Amharic but it may take the rest of this twenty first century before even a
fraction of the literary output of other civilizations is available in any
single African language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> As matters now stand, an African who has a good command of
a European language has probably assimilated other aspects of western culture
as well.  This is because the process of acquiring a European language in
Africa has tended to be overwhelmingly through a formal system of western-style
education.  It is because of this that the concept of an African physicist who
is not also westernized is for the time-being a <u>socio-linguistic
impossibility</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>This need not apply to a Chinese or
Japanese physicist, where it is possible to engage in a scientific conversation
at a sophisticated level without the explicit mediation of a foreign language. 
Japan and Korea especially have tamed their languages to cope with a wide range
of intellectual discourse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But in black Africa for the time being a modern surgeon
who does not speak a European language is virtually a socio-linguistic
impossibility.  So is a modern chemist, zoologist and economist.  The ambition
to be culturally close to African society clashes with the ambition to be

cultural proximity to African society. </p>

and parts of Eastern Africa the imperial founders of African universities had
no choice.  The great majority of African languages did not have enough
speakers to justify the massive financial and intellectual investment necessary
for making them effective media of higher education.  But even those African
languages like Kiswahili which stood a chance of developing in that direction
did not receive adequate imperial support.  As for Arabic in the Sudan, there
continued to be discordance between the English language as a medium at
Khartoum University and the Arabicorientation of pre-university education, with
severe costs in quality for all levels of instruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

African universities were being established, African intellectuals had already

and then declined in the post colonial era, intellectualism in indigenous
languages was handicapped quite early by the policies of both the colonial and
post-colonial eras.  The imperial powers did sow the seeds of  African

tended to undermine intellectualism “in the vernacular”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

this new basis of stratification.  They helped to give western culture as a
whole greater legitimacy in African societies.  They produced teachers for
lower levels of education and thus helped to continue the Eurocentric tradition
of the colonial educational system.  The universities also produced
opinion-leaders in other public pursuits.  The university degree itself was for
a while a major passport to influence and opportunity.  The class-systems of
African societies were in a state of flux, and cultural dependency was part of
this problem of restratification. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In fairness to some African governments
and educational reformers, we must recognize some of the agonized efforts that
have been made to modify the colonial heritage.  In Kenyatta’s Kenya alone at
least three major educational commissions (Ominde 1964, Ndegwa 1971 and
Gachathi 1978) once dealt with educational reforms – not to mention numerous
workshops and seminars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But reforms in Daniel arap Moi’s Kenya were even faster in
coming.  Some important concessions have been made to Kiswahili.  It enjoys
more attention at the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University than it has
ever done before, though the attention is still modest in resources.  The
status of Kiswahili at lower levels of Kenya’s educational system is also
modest, in spite of the elevation of the language into the “national language”
of Kenya with English as the “official language”.  English continues to
overshadow Kiswahili decisively at least from the third year of schooling
onwards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In terms of political stratification, an important step
was taken when Kiswahili was adopted as the language of Kenya’s parliament from
1974 to 1979.  But significant anomalies remained.  Whereas written legislation
in Kenya’s parliament was still presented in English, the debate on that
legislation was conducted in Kiswahili.  The speech on the budget continued to
be made in English with full political and diplomatic ceremony.  The minimum
qualifications required of a parliamentary candidate continued to include
competence in the English language – but no necessarily competence in
Kiswahili.  After Kenyatta, debate could be in either language in parliament. 
The most important language of national politics is now </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

establishment of the country continues to consist disproportionately of those
who have been initiated into the culture of the former imperial system.  The
public universities are central to the structure which is perpetuating the
Britannic factor in Kenya’s system of political stratification.  But some of
those universities have also started the slow and difficult process of
Africanizing African universities.  This agenda for re-Africanization needs a
closer look. </p>

African bureaucracies than directly to the production processes of African

power in most African countries is on the whole a product of Western
education.  The impact of this class of people on patterns of consumption in
African countries is sometimes greater than their impact on levels of
production.  But, the centrality of their position in African political systems
has in many cases made them custodians of the highest levels of economic policy
in their countries – for better or for worse.  </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'> We have sought to demonstrate in this paper that the
African University is part of a chain of dependency that continues to tie
Africa to the Western world.  African perspectives, models of communication,
structures of stratification, rules of interaction, standards of evaluation,
motives of behavior and patterns of production and consumption have all been
undergoing the agonies of change partly under the disturbing impact of Western
culture.  African universities have been the highest transmitters of Western
culture in African societies.  The high priests of Western civilization in the
continent are virtually all products of those cultural seminaries called
“universities”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> On balance the African university is caught up in the
tension between its ambition to promote genuine development in Africa and its
continuing role in the consolidation of cultural dependency.  If genuine
development has to include <u>cultural decolonization</u>, a basic
contradiction persists in the ultimate functions of an African university.  It
may generate skills relevant for modernization and development.  But it has not
even begun to acquire, let alone to transmit to others, what is perhaps the
most fundamental skill of them all – how to promote development in a
post-colonial state without consolidating the structures of dependency
inherited from its imperial past. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

decolonization of modernity</u>, then some major strategies are needed for
African development – two of them are capable of rapid implementation, while
others are for slower but sustained introduction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The first strategy concerns the <u>domestication of
modernity</u>:  the bid to relate it more firmly to local cultural and economic
needs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The second strategy is paradoxical.  It involves <u>the
wider diversification of the cultural</u> <u>content of modernity</u>.  Under
this approach the foreign reference-group for an African institution becomes
not only the West but also other non-African civilizations.  The African
university is thus to be transformed <u>from a multinational to a multicultural
corporation</u>.  The third strategy is perhaps the most ambitious.  It
concerns an attempt by the African continent as a whole to <u>counter-penetrate
western civilization itself</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Let us take each of these strategies, beginning with the
imperative of domestication in relation to education.  Until now there has been
no doubt that African educational systems have entered deeply into the
life-styles of local societies, for better or for worse.  In the very process
of producing educated manpower, creating new forms of stratification,
accelerating Westernization and modernization, African educational institutions
have been major instruments through which the Western world has affected and
changed the continent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In order to shift this balance, African societies must be
allowed fundamentally to influence the educational systems themselves.  It is
not enough for an African university to send a traveling theatre to perform a
play by Shakespeare or even by the Nigerian playwright, Wole Soyinka, before
rural audiences in different villages.  This type of endeavor is indeed
required, and helps to deepen the life experiences of folk communities in the
villages.  But the traveling theatre of a university like Makerere or Nairobi
is one more form of academic impact on the wider society.  It does not by
itself constitute a reverse flow of influence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Similarly, extra-mural departments and even extension
services are valuable methods of increasing skills and expanding social
awareness among rural communities.  Like a number of other professors at
Makerere University in Uganda, I traveled many miles on hard roads to address
village schools and assemblies on the implications of public policies in Uganda
and the nature of the political system of the country.  That kind of commitment
was a way of reaching out to the isolated groups of the African countryside. 
But once again it was much less an exercise in being affected by the society
than an exercise in reaching the society.  The social impact was still
one-sided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The first task, then, in decolonizing modernity is to seek
cultural nearness to African society and to enable the influence of the local
society to balance that of the Western reference group.  But how is this
process to be realized in the universities?  Four major areas have to be
examined afresh:  the requirements for admission of students, the content of
curses throughout the educational system, the criteria for recruitment of
teachers and other staff, and the general structure of the educational system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> University admission requirements should be reformed in
the direction of giving new weight to certain subjects of indigenous
relevance.  Social and cultural anthropology ought to become a secondary school
subject, rigorously examinable, and required for entry to university.  This
should help promote considerably more interest in African cultures in primary
and secondary schools.  Secondly, admission to a university should include a
requirement for a pass in an African language.  There were times when many African
universities required some competence in Latin for entry into some faculties;
the African university of the future should require competence, formally
demonstrated in an examination, of at least one African language regardless of
the subject that the student proposes to study once admitted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> African dance and music should be given a new legitimacy
in all primary and secondary schools, regardless of the sensitivities of the
missionary authorities in power.  Investigation should be undertaken into
whether dance and music should be competitive, and in what way the ethnic
diversity of musicological experience can be made creative rather than
disruptive in an African school.  These problems are far from insurmountable,
and could add a new richness to African aesthetic experience alongside the imported
recreations of sports and athletics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Progress has already been made in the teaching of African
history and literature.  Further progress can be made, including more effective
utilization of oral literature, duly transcribed, as an introduction to the
pre-literate aesthetic creativity of African societies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The university in turn should re-examine the content of
its courses, permitting indigenous culture to penetrate more into the
university, and non-Western alien contributions to find a hearing at African
universities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Recruitment of faculty will in turn be affected by these
considerations.  Must all teachers at an African university have formal degrees
from Western or Western-type educational institutions?  Or should there be
areas of expertise where lecturers or even professors could be appointed
without the degree requirement so characteristic of Western institutions?  Okot
p’Bitek once compared the recruitment requirements for a university with the
electoral requirements for an African parliament.  African parliaments have on
the whole insisted on competence in either English or French before an African
could become a member.  A candidate could speak ten African languages, and
still be ineligible for parliament, if he did not speak the imported
metropolitan language.  Conversely, a candidate could speak only English or
French, and no African language, not even the language of his immediate
constituents, and still be eligible for parliament.  Okot p’Bitek saw the
linguistic and formal requirements for a parliamentary career in Africa: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:3.1pt;
margin-left:36.5pt'>You cannot become a member of <u>their</u> parliament
unless you can speak English or French … you may be the greatest oral historian
but they will never allow you anywhere near <u>their</u> University … Our
Universities and schools are nests in which black exploiters are hatched and
bred, at the expense of the taxpayers, or perhaps heartpayers.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> The question which arises is whether there are specialists
of oral history in African societies who can be appointed to university
faculties without having a formal degree.  Presumably this might be difficult
if these oral historians are unable to read or write.  A compromise situation
would be one in which only those oral historians who can in addition read and
write might be regarded as eligible.  Admittedly, literary skills are still a
departure from ancestral ways in many African societies, but even readiness to
acknowledge competence regardless of formal Western-type degrees would be
revolutionary in African universities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> A related area is that of African languages.  There are
specialists in African languages who know not only how to use an African
language, but also how the language behaves.  Some of these are superb teachers
at university level.  I know of at least one who spent many years in an
American university, teaching Kiswahili with a sophistication unmatched by many
of those who have actual degrees in the subject and in Bantu linguistics.  Yet
in the United States he could never hope to have a proper tenure appointment or
even formal rank, since he did not possess a degree.  Yet the same university
would be quite prepared to appoint a distinguished British Swahilist from the
London School of Oriental and African Studies, with a less intimate knowledge
of certain African languages than the Kenyan with a demonstrated competence
over several decades. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> There is a case for broadening the criteria for recruiting
academic staff to include both formal degrees and, where appropriate,
indigenous traditional skills adequately demonstrated and capable of being
effectively utilized on both teaching and research at the university level.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'>Clearly a hybrid of cultures is at play here, and staff
recruitment could reflect this dualism.  Departments of sociology could have
indigenous specialists in oral traditions; departments and faculties of
medicine and preventive medicine could include specialists in indigenous herbs,
and might even examine the medical implications of sorcery and witchcraft as
part of the general training of a rural doctor in Africa.  Departments of
history, literature, musicology, philosophy and religious studies could all allow
for the possibility of recruiting skills on a different set of criteria from
that which has been honoured in Western institutions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> But in addition to reforms encompassing student admission
requirements, curricula, faculty recruitment, there must be a broader
structural transformation which relates general social needs to the educational
system, and which reduces the tendency toward a pyramid educational structure
with the university at the top, and everything below that being no more than a
step toward the pinnacle.  What is needed is a major change involving a
diversification of the content of the curricula of each institution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> At the university level, should studies continue to be
organized according to conventional western disciplinary categories?  Or is
there a case for having on the one hand a School of Rural Studies, encompassing
agriculture, anthropology, preventive medicine in rural conditions, and the

continuum, labour migration, ethnic associations, criminology and relevant
preventive medicine?  Other possible schools could include Oral Tradition and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

relevance domestically defined, and which related to both the economic and
cultural needs of the society as a whole. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> The second strategy of development is that of diversifying
the cultural content of modernity.  This approach rests partly on the
assumption that just as economically it is a greater risk to be dependent on
one country than on many, so in culture one foreign benefactor is more
constraining than many.  To be owned by one person is outright slavery; but to
be owned by many masters, who can be played against each other, may be the
beginning of freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> The African university has to move from being a
multinational corporation to a multicultural corporation.  From what we have
discussed, it is clear that in spite of the fact that African university
systems have grown up with structural or other links with metropolitan
universities in Europe and North America, the African university has continued
to be heavily uni-cultural:  it has been more a manifestation of western
culture in an African situation than an outgrowth of African culture itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> For as long as the African university remained a
multinational corporation in this sense, it denied itself the wealth of its own
society.  But in order to become a multicultural corporation it is not enough
to combine African traditions with the Western heritage.  It becomes more
important than ever that African universities should take seriously the
cultures and experiments of other civilizations.  The educational system should
not simply talk about European history, combined increasingly with African history,
but should in addition pay attention to Indian civilizations, Chinese
civilizations and most immediate of all, Islamic civilizations.  Although
Arabic is the most widely spoken language in the African continent, the
language has received very little acknowledgement in the educational syllabi of
Africa south of the Sahara.  It has not even received recognition from
countries bordering Arabicspeaking areas, or with large numbers of Muslims
among their own citizens.  The Muslim community in Nigeria runs into millions,
and the bordering countries contain millions more, yet Nigeria’s universities
once favoured Latin and Greek rather than Arabic studies.  As for Chinese
studies, there is at most some interest in Mao Tse-tung in political science
departments these days, but still no interest in Confucius.  Mao’s China is
relevant not only to ideology and economic organization, but also to
intermediate technology, medicine and new methods of agriculture.  A conscious
effort to learn more about what is done in China since Mao, and an attempt to
see how much of it is relevant for African needs could help to add technical
richness to cultural pluralism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> A multicultural corporation requires not only a revival of
interest in African indigenous traditions, but also a cultural diversification
of the foreign component in African curricula.  A twin process is then
underway:  increased Africanization, as the society is permitted to reciprocate
the impact of the university; and increased internationalization as the foreign
component ceases to be Euro-centric and attention is paid to other parts of the
total human heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> An important subject which should be introduced into
African secondary schools is the history of science.  It is possible that the
dependency complex among young African school children arises partly out of
their being overwhelmed by Western science.  The prestige of the Western world,
in a continent which is very conscious of the power of prestige, derives
disproportionately from Western leadership in science and technology.  So great
has that leadership been in the last 300 years that Westernism and science are
sometimes regarded as interchangeable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> In reaction to this Western scientific pre-eminence, some
Africans have sought refuge in <u>negritude</u> as glorification of a
non-scientific civilization.  The leader of negritude as a romantic movement in
Africa, Leopold Senghor, former President of Senegal, has defined negritude as
“the sum of African cultural values” informed by their “emotive attitude toward
the world”.<sup>3</sup>  Other Africans have sought answers in Marxism – partly
because it seems to offer Africans the chance of  rebelling against the West
without ceasing to be scientific.  After all, was not the Marxist heritage a
scientific critique of the West?  These two responses symbolize wider forces at
work in Africa.  The negritudist rebels against the scientific West by
idealizing his own heritage; the African Marxist rebels against the West by
embracing an alternative scientism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> Leopold Senghor, a cultural nationalist, has been denounced
by some African radicals as an intellectual primitivist who has tried to reduce
African modes of knowledge to pure emotion and has turned the history of Africa
into the story of the Noble Savage.  But, Senghor denies that the has deprived
the African of the capacity to reason and innovate technologically. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.6pt;
margin-left:36.5pt'>It is a fact that there is a white European civilization
and a black African civilization.  The question is to explain their differences
and the reasons for these differences, which my opponents have not yet done.  I
can refer them back to their authorities.  ‘Reason has always existed’, wrote
Marx to Arnold Ruge, ‘but not always under the rational form’.<sup>4</sup>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:4.8pt'>Senghor then proceeds to quote Engels, whom he regards as
even more explicit on this question in his work “preparatory to the <u>Anti-Duhring</u>”:
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.95pt;
margin-left:36.5pt'>Two kinds of experience … one exterior, material; the
other, interior; laws of thought and forms of thinking.  Forms of thinking also
partly transmitted by heredity.  A mathematical axiom is self-evident to a
European, but not to a Bushman or an Australian aboriginal.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> This debate between African cultural  nationalists and
African scientific scholars is likely to continue for the rest of this
century.  What the two  groups have in common is a rebellion against the West
and the inferiority complex which had been created by Western scientific
pre-eminence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> The curriculum in African schools should at some stage
reflect these disagreements.  But at least as fundamental as the question of
whether African culture was traditionally scientific or whether Marxism is a
science is the issue of how much Western science owes to other civilizations. 
From the Indus Valley to ancient Egypt, from imperial China to medieval Islam,
the West has found intellectual and scientific benefactors over the centuries. 
Yet very little of this is communicated to young children in schools in
Africa.  The cultural pluralism which lies behind the scientific heritage is
lost to these young minds, as they continue to be dazzled at a formative period
by Western civilization alone.  Secondary school curricula in Africa must
therefore put science in its proper historical context, reveal the diversity of
the human heritage, and break the dangerous myth of Western scientific
pre-eminence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> Another major change which would need to be introduced into
primary and secondary schools concerns the teaching of languages.  Each African
child should learn a minimum of three languages – one European, one Asian and
one African.  The era of learning multiple European languages – some ancient
and some modern – while other linguistic heritages of the world are ignored
should come rapidly to an end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> Because of the colonial legacy, some African students in
former British Africa will need to learn French and some francophone Africans
will continue to learn English.  PanAfricanism will need the teaching of an
additional European language for a minority of students.  But any additional
European language has to be a fourth language – chosen instead of, say,
geography or fine art, but certainly not at the expense of either an African
language or an Asian one.  These linguistic requirements are partly based on
the assumption that access to a culture is considerably facilitated by
knowledge of its language.  At the university level, language requirements
should continue in a modified form.  Each undergraduate – regardless of the
field – should take either an African or an Asian language at an advanced
level.  In addition they should take a course on a non-Western civilization,
preferably, but not necessarily, linked to the language of his choice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> But perhaps the most fundamental of all reforms must be a
change in attitude in all departments in African universities away from
excessive Eurocentrism and toward a paradoxical combination of increased
Africanization and increased internationalization of the content of each
department programme.  It is only in this way that the African university can

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.0pt'> But domestication of modernity and the diversification of
its cultural content will not achieve final fulfillment without reversing the
flow of influence back into Western civilization itself:  there are reformers
in Africa who urge only domestication – and some of them would go to the extent
of espousing cultural autarky.  But this is a strategy of withdrawal from world
culture, the outcome of which could be the continuing marginality of Africa in
global affairs.  In a world which has shrunk so much in a single century, there
will be many decisions made by others which are bound to affect the world as a
whole.  For Africa to attempt a strategy of withdrawal or total disengagement
would be a counsel not only of despair but also of dangerous futility.  Modernity
is here to stay; the task is to decolonize it.  World culture is evolving fast,
the task is to save it from excessive Eurocentrism.  The question which arises
is how this task is to be achieved.<sup>6</sup>   This is where the strategy of
counterpenetration is relevant.  If African cultures have been penetrated so
deeply by the West, how is Western culture to be reciprocally penetrated by
Africa?  The West has not, of course, completely escaped from Africa’s cultural
influence.  It has been estimated that the first piece of carving made by an
African to reach modern Europe arrived on a Portuguese trading ship in 1504. 
African workmanship in leather and probably gold had a much older presence in
Europe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.0pt;text-indent:27.0pt'>However, African art burst upon the
awareness of the Western world only in the turn of the nineteenth century. 
Army men like Pitt-Rivers and Torday brought back large collections with good
ethnographic description …. No one should jump to the idea that Picasso’s women
who look two ways at once, or anything else about his work, is a copy of
something he discovered in African art.  There was little direct, stylistic
influence, although some can be discovered by latter-day critics.  Rather, what
happened was that with the discovery of African and other exotic art, the way
was discovered for breaking out of the confines that had been imposed on
European art by tradition – perspective, measured maturalism, and
anti-intellectual sentimentality.<sup>7 </sup> At least as important as this
artistic counter-penetration has been Africa’s indirect influence through its
sons and daughters exported to the New World as slaves.  Africa’s impact on
jazz and related forms of music has already been documented.  So has the
influence of African tales on the literatures of other lands, particularly of
the Southern United States and the Caribbean area. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'> Africa’s cultural influence on the West has been far more
modest than the West’s influence on Africa.  This asymmetry will continue for
at least the rest of this century, but the gap in reciprocity can be narrowed. 
To achieve this, Africa will need allies.  The continent’s most natural allies
consist of the Black Diaspora and the Arab World.  The </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:9.5pt;line-height:107%'>Arabs share a continent with black people. 
Indeed, the majority of the Arabs are within </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.6pt;
margin-left:9.5pt;line-height:107%'>Africa; so is the bulk of Arab land.  Black
and African states share the Organization of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'>African Unity.  This organization and the Arab League have
overlapping membership.  There are possibilities of exploiting this
relationship to the mutual advantage of both peoples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.9pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'> The Arab oil-producers have already started the strategy of
economic counterpenetration into the West.  This ranges from buying real estate
in England to controlling a bank in the United States, from acquiring a
considerable share in the Benz complex in West Germany to the possibility of
extending a loan to Italy.  The whole strategy of recycling petrodollars is
full of possibilities of economic counter-penetration.  As a result, the West
is at once eager for the petrodollars and anxious about its long-term
consequences for Western economic independence.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'> But alongside this risk is an opportunity for a new Third
World alliance to counterpenetrate the West.  Once again economic power and
cultural influence might be linked.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is heavily Muslim in composition, and includes the largest Muslim
country in the world, Indonesia.  The largest oil-exporting country is Saudi
Arabia, where the spiritual capital of Islam, Mecca, is to be found.  The
second largest oil-exporter is Iran which is, when at peace, an increasingly
influential Muslim country in world affairs.  Two-thirds of the membership of
OPEC is Muslim – but represents over two-thirds of OPEC’s oil reserves. 
Nigeria, another OPEC member, contains all three parts of the soul of modern
Africa – the Euro-Christian, the Islamic, and the indigenous religious
traditions.  All three are vigorous – and Islam is already the strongest single
rival to Westernism there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'> The rise of OPEC in world affairs – however transient – may
herald the political resurrection of Islam.  Before the end of  this century
African Muslims will probably outnumber the Arabs and will be making a strong
bid for shared leadership of Islam.  It would not be surprising if, within the
next decade, black Muslims direct from Africa are establishing schools and
hospitals in Harlem and preaching Islam to black Americans.  The funding for
this Islamic counter-penetration will probably come from the oil-producers of
the Arab world.  But since African Islam is distinct from Arab Islam, and
carries considerable indigenous culture within it, Islamic counter-penetration
into the United States would also be, in part, a process of transmitting
African indigenous perspectives as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'> But at least as important as Arab money for African
cultural entry into the West is the black American population.  The second
largest Anglophone black nation in the world (second only to Nigeria), Black
America, is situated in the middle of the richest and mightiest country in the
twentieth century.  At the moment, Black American influence on </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'>America’s cultural and intellectual life is much more modest
than, say, the influence of Jewish America.  But as the poverty of black
America lessens, its social and political horizons widen, and its intellectual
and creative core expands, Black American influence on American culture is
bound to increase.  A central task for African universities will therefore be
to reach out to black America, and, by influencing the most powerful country of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:9.5pt'> We should diversify the civilizations from which we learn. 
The world consists of more than merely Africa and the West.  Should our
universities learn more about how Japan modernized?  If Ghana and Korea were at
the same economic level in 1957, why is Korea today the eleventh industrial
power in the world – while Ghana is still underdeveloped?  Can African
universities learn from the Japanese and the Koreans in order to help Kenya and
Africa find alternative models of development? </p>
