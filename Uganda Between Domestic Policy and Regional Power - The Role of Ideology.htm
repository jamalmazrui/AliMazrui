text-decoration:none'> </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In the case of Uganda since
independence, each durable government has had to grapple with both kinds of
ideologies - and tried to seek a balance between the two.  Uganda under the
first leadership of A. Milton Obote (1962-1971) was the least Pan-African of
the three members of the East African Community.  It was quite suspicious of
greater union with the other two countries of the Community (Kenya and Tanzania),
and was only modestly involved in the politics of  liberation in Southern
Africa.  This relatively low level of Uganda’s Pan-Africanism was inspite of
Milton Obote’s apparent admiration for Kwame Nkrumah and subsequent friendship
with Julius K. Nyerere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Uganda
under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni (who captured power in 1986) has </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>become the most
Pan-African of the former members of the East African Community, and the most
regionally active and interventionist in the Great Lakes area.  This has constituted
quite a sharp transition from the relative national parochialism of Milton
Obote’s first administration to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>the wide ranging regional
activism and Pan-African interventionism of the Museveni years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But how did these differences in
the external policies of the two governments relate to their domestic
policies?  Obote’s first administration started off as market-oriented and
pluralistic.  But from 1966 onwards, in response to both constitutional
upheavals in Uganda and ideological trends in neighbouring Tanzania, Milton
Obote and his Uganda People’s Congress began to manifest a shift in rhetoric. 
By 1969, this shift had certainly become a “move to the left”.  Uganda was in
the early stages of trying to build a socialist state, guided by <u>The Common </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.35pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><u>Man’s Charter</u>.  The
influence of Julius K. Nyerere’s <u>Arusha Declaration</u> was unmistakable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In contrast, Yoweri Museveni started on the left
ideologically.  In the 1970s he was virtually a Marxist-Leninist.  People like
Robert Mugabe were radicalized by armed struggle. Yoweri Museveni was <u>deradicalized</u>
by armed struggle.  Robert Mugabe became more and more of a socialist in the
heat of the liberation war.  Yoweri Museveni became less and less of a
socialist in the tensions of armed struggle against the Obote regime.  It took
a while for this desocialization of Museveni to translate into policies after
he captured power in Uganda in 1986.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>While Obote’s first administration was
characterized by a “Move to the Left”, Museveni’s years in the twentieth
century have been inspired by a “move to the right.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.3pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>These then are the

radicalism in domestic policies.  Museveni displayed adventurous Pan-</p>

neighbours but cautious pro-market pragmatism in domestic policies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Were the external and internal
ideological orientations mutually related? To some extent they were.  In his
first Administration, Milton Obote became even less Pan-East African as he
tried to become more socialist.  This is because Milton Obote - like Julius K.
Nyerere before him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.65pt;

as <u>self-reliance</u> rather than as <u>interdependence</u> with neighbours.      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In the case of Nyerere, the logic

him to take action against free movement of labour and capital between Tanzania

the two positions are related. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.35pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>With regard to only one of Uganda’s neighbours was Milton
Obote’s first administration more Pan-Africanist than Museveni’s government. 
The neighbour is the Sudan.  In Obote’s last full year in office in his first
administration (1969-1971), he led the way in trying to improve relations with
Khartoum.  He handed over to the Sudanese government in 1970 one of the Key
German mercenaries supporting the southern Anya Nya movement.  Obote put
Pan-Africanism above pan-tribalism in the concluding year of his first
administration. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>  Yoweri Museveni, on the other
hand, has presided over the worst relations between Uganda and Sudan since
independence.  Khartoum and Kampala have been supporting each other’s rebels in
newer and more brutal ways.  Pan Africanism has given way to narrower and less
honourable loyalties.  There is yet another external orientation affecting the
two governments.  Obote was originally in power at the height of the Cold War
between the capitalist world led by the United States and its NATO allies on
one side, and the communist world led by the Soviet Union and its allies in the
Warsaw Pact, on the other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Yoweri Museveni came into power
when the Cold War was coming to an end.  Idi Amin was in-between.  Let us now
look at all these three leaders in relation to the dialectic between capitalism
and communism both domestically and internationally in Uganda’s unique
experience. </p>

.65pt'>Ideology and the Cold War<span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:
none'> </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>A curious ideological paradox was
played out in Uganda under its three most important presidents - Milton Obote,
Idi Amin and Yoweri Museveni.  In the First Republic under Milton Obote
(1966-1971) the country flirted with socialism at home while remaining
basically part of the Western camp in foreign policy.  In the so-called
&quot;Second Republic&quot; under Idi Amin Dada </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>(1971-1979)
the country flirted with the Soviet Union in foreign policy, while trying to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Africanize
capitalism at home.  Under Yoweri Museveni capitalism at home and
pro-Westernism in foreign policy converged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Obote tried to turn the country
into a socialist country without distancing himself too far from the West.  Idi
Amin acted in ways which did distance him from the West, but in pursuit of the
indigenization of capitalism.  Museveni was less worried about whether
capitalism was indigenized or not - provided it was quite unrestricted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In reality Milton Obote's
&quot;Move to the Left&quot; (1969-1971) was influenced more by Julius K.
Nyerere than by Karl Marx.  As we indicated, Obote's <u>Common Man's Charter</u>
was inspired more by the Arusha Declaration in neighboring Tanzania than by <u>The
Communist Manifesto</u> in European history.  In his last two years in office
Obote's first administration sounded more leftist in rhetoric.  The stage was
being set for some nationalization measures, for a national service, and for a
more centralized economy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The actual socialist rhetoric did
not gather momentum until 1969.  But it is arguable that the move to the left
began in 1966-7 with the moves against the monarchies.  Before Milton Obote
declared himself against <u>capitalism</u> in 1969, he declared himself against
&quot;<u>feudalism</u>&quot; in 1966.  Vladimir Lenin went radically socialist
before he abolished the monarchy in Russia.  Milton Obote reversed the order. 
He abolished the monarchies in Uganda in 1967 complete with a republican
constitution before he declared himself a radical socialist. </p>

power.  Yoweri Museveni did restore most of the monarchies of Uganda - though
he did not restore all their powers and properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In his socialist phase Milton
Obote was indeed basically pro-Western in foreign policy, but did draw the line
on American involvement in Vietnam and in the Congo (formerly Zaire) in the
1960s and on soft British  policies towards the Republic of South Africa and
towards Rhodesia under Ian Smith.  Milton Obote was in fact the first African
leader to publicly criticize the American military involvement in Vietnam.  And
his eagerness to put Prime Minister Edward Heath in the dock over Britain's
policies towards Southern Africa took Milton Obote and his friend at the time,
Julius Nyerere, to the Commonwealth conference of Heads of State and Government
in Singapore in 1971.  The trip to Singapore probably cost Obote his first
presidency.  He was overthrown in his absence by Idi Amin Dada on January 25,
1971. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Idi Amin's administration started
as quite popular with the West and with Israel.  His first trips abroad as
president were, in part, to meet two very distinguished women - Prime Minister
Golda Meir in Israel and Queen Elizabeth II in Britain.  In his first year in
office Idi Amin received one Western diplomatic hug after another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.8pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>His troubles with the West had three major causes. 
Firstly, his regime became increasingly and embarrassingly repressive. 
Secondly, Idi Amin - who was helped into power by Israel in January 1971 -
turned against his Israeli benefactors in 1972 and expelled them from Uganda
lock, stock, and barrel.  The third factor which alienated Idi Amin from the
West was paradoxically his quest to indigenize capitalism.  The effort went
wrong when the strategy adopted by Idi Amin included the expulsion of the Asian
population of Uganda, most of whom were of British nationality.  Later on, Idi
Amin also taunted the West with repeated public insults and abuse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>His alienation from the West made
Idi Amin increasingly dependent on the oil-rich Arabs economically, on the one
hand, and on the Soviet Union for military and diplomatic support, on the other
hand.  By the concluding years of the 1970s the Soviet Union's closest friend
in Eastern Africa after Ethiopia was, in fact, Uganda. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Yoweri Museveni, once the most
anti-Western of all those, lived to become almost totally uncritical of Western
powers.  Scholars have traced the origins of the sovereign nation-state to the
Treaty of Westphalia of 1648.  Museveni became both a challenge to the
sovereignty of Westphalia and a symbol of <u>Westphilia</u>.  He challenged the
sovereign state by regional interventionism; He manifested Westphilia by
excessive admiration of the West.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The ideological ironies of the
different regimes of Uganda were now complete.  ProSoviet Idi Amin had
succeeded pro-socialist Milton Obote; the leader of the &quot;Move to the
Left&quot; had been overthrown by a future client of Moscow.  Museveni became a
pro-marketeer par excellence.  Underlying all those years was a more enduring
ideological reality in Uganda - a profound distrust of socialism as an answer
to Uganda's problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>But have most Ugandans distrusted
socialism because they associated it with Marxism?  And do they distrust
Marxism because they have reduced it to Leninism?  <u>Has Uganda's hostility
towards socialism been a case of mistaken identity</u>?  Such a question could
be addressed to many other countries as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Long before the collapse of
communism in Europe, public opinion in Uganda has been consistently unimpressed
by the new fangled ideas of Marxism-Leninism.  When in much of post-colonial
Africa, radical socialism was intellectually respectable, most Ugandans refused
to be mobilized behind Milton Obote's <u>Move to the Left</u> (1969-1971). 
Obote's strategy had the support of some leftist intellectuals, but did not
arouse great enthusiasm at the grassroots.  Even young Museveni in exile was
fascinated by this lure of the Left, but he was unrepresentative of Ugandan
opinion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Were Ugandans against Marxism? 
Or only against Leninism?  We shall never know for certain, because in the
twentieth century Marxism has so often been linked to Leninism - and </p>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Marx has seldom had a chance
to be evaluated on his own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>When Marx was alive he certainly
did not think that Russia was anywhere near a socialist revolution.  Marx did
not think that the Czars (or Kings of Russia) had outlived their role.  It is
conceivable that Karl Marx, on being resurrected, would have concluded that
Uganda in the 1960s was not yet ready for the abolition of the monarchies
either.  The country had not yet reached a proper bourgeois stage.  It was
Leninism which was impatient for revolution in Russia, even if it meant
executing the Czar and his family.  Neo-Leninists in Africa also demanded the
abolition of African monarchies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Marxism on its own could have
accommodated some devolution of power to the kingdoms in Uganda in the 1960s
and an acceptance of evolutionary change.  It was impatient Leninism which
insisted on what it called &quot;democratic centralism&quot; as a basis of the
highly centralized state.  Many African socialists were influenced by this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Marxism on its own could have
accepted a multiparty system in Uganda.  It was Leninism and its influence
which insisted on a vanguard party in a socialist country, virtually
monopolizing   political power.  Obote's first administration seemed to be
moving inexorably towards a oneparty state, so popular at the time elsewhere in
eastern Africa.  While Obote himself was hardly a Leninist, he was surrounded
by intellectuals who had been influenced by pseudo-Leninism.  They were urging
him on towards what would have been, to all intents and purposes, a vanguard
party in Uganda - the Uganda People's Congress (UPC).  Is Museveni’s “No-Party”
doctrine a retreat from partism.  Or is the “no-party” doctrine just another
version of the vanguard party? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Nobody in Africa attempted to
have Marxism without Leninism.  Nobody attempted to <u>de-Leninize</u> the
package of Marxism sponsored by the Soviet Union.  But Ugandans at any rate
discovered quite early that there was a serious flaw in the whole ideological
package.  Long before Mikhail Gorbachev, Ugandans already believed in a kind of
<u>Nilostroika</u> of their own - putting pragmatism before centralizing
ideology.  Historical pragmatism was much more compatible with Marxism on its
own rather than with Leninism.  On the whole, Marx was a historical relativist;
Lenin was a historical absolutist.  Theoretically Ugandans might have given
Marx a chance - but would never have given approval to Lenin.  Anti-socialist
sentiment in </p>

opposition to the Leninist disrespect for gradual change, to the Leninist
impatience with monarchy, to the Leninist promotion of strong statism, to the
Leninist championing of centralism, and to the Leninist invention of a vanguard
monopolistic party.  But in the end Ugandans were forced to throw out the
Marxist baby with the Leninist bathwater, perhaps the socialist baby with the
pseudo-Marxist bathwater.  Even Yoweri Museveni got radically de-socialized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>There was something even in
Marxism itself that Ugandans would have been opposed to anyhow - and that is
the atheistic component of Marxism, with or without Leninism.  Certainly the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The struggle continues in Uganda
to find a domestically oriented ideology which does justice to the continuities
of history and the compatibilities of culture.  Yoweri Museveni has tried to
find the balance in an economy without the state; a state without political
parties; and in monarchies without power.  Keeping the state out of the economy
is designed to maximize market returns; keeping political parties out of the
state system seeks to minimize ethnic rivalries; withholding power from the
kings seeks to promote constitutional monarchies in an </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>As for Museveni’s Pan-African and

further.  First, to what extent does the participation of African countries in

military peacemaking a contribution to the regional and national <u>development</u>
of the countries involved? </p>

involvement in the quest for pacification in Rwanda and (in a different sense)
in the quest for a solution in the Congo and in the Sudan has contributed to a
conciliatory spirit within Uganda itself and to a greater Ugandan commitment to
domestic development?  Does regional <u>Pax Ugandanica</u> help the cause for
domestic national integration?  What about misbehaving Ugandan soldiers?  Are
they now held more accountable for their behaviour? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Muhammad Buhari
declare military rule as “outdated and out-of-tune with the times”.  To what

demilitarizing attitudes contribute to economic and political development in
Nigeria?  Now a former military ruler of the 1970s, General Olusegun Obasanjo,
has been elected civilian president for the new millennium.  Was this domestic
democratization helped by Nigeria’s regional role? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In reality it is too soon to be
sure of the long term consequences of military intervention for either the
target country (like Sierra Leone or Congo) or the intervening country (like
Nigeria or Uganda).  But it is never too soon to start asking questions about
the cause and effect of policy options.  This essay seeks to ask such questions
and to solicit at least tentative answers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The case-studies available are
diverse.  The Great Lakes area affords examples of diverse forms of
intervention.  Somalia combined the intervention of the United Nations with the
military intervention of a superpower (the United States).  Mozambique and
Angola are cases of intervention by the United Nations <u>without</u> the
military engagement of Washington.  Sierra Leone and Liberia were cases of
intervention by a regional body (ECOMOG) with a regional vanguard (Nigeria). 
Tanzania’s intervention in 1979 into Idi Amin’s Uganda was a case of
single-power international vigilantism.  The 1998 conflict between Eritrea and
Ethiopia raises the spectre of inter-state conflicts in Africa – starting with
high propensity in the Horn of Africa (also </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Ethiopia vs.
Somalia; Eritrea vs. Sudan).  And Yoweri Museveni has continued his one-man
ECOMOG role in Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan.  The struggle to contain
such conflicts by regional powers may be part of the process of domestic
demilitarization and national development. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>When I started the debate about
inter-African colonization in 1992, few people took me seriously.  By the time
Archie Mafeje, the South African Scholar, discovered my thesis about
self-colonization, Archie went vitriolic and abusive in <u>CODESRIA Bulletin</u>! 
Other critics internationally have argued that my thesis was either evil or
unreal.  Yet by the second half of the decade it was evident that history was
indeed turning in my direction.  Africans were beginning to assert control over
their unruly neighbours, though sometimes bungling the worthy mission, and
sometimes getting in each other’s way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The most dramatic of these events
was Uganda's role in helping the Tutsi to reassert control over Rwanda in
1994.  This was a kind of &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; operation, African style. 
The original Bay of Pigs project launched by President John F. Kennedy in 1961
consisted of Cuban exiles trained by the United States to invade Cuba in the
hope of overthrowing Fidel Castro.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>They were
intended to land in the Bay of Pigs in Cuba and start an anti-Castro

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>More than thirty years later
exiled Rwandans trained in Uganda invaded Rwanda in order to overthrow the Hutu
regime there and to end the genocide against the Tutsi.  The aim of the Rwanda
Patriotic Front from Uganda was not counter-genocide but conquest and control. 
This particular &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; operation--African style--was completely
successful in 1994. </p>

&quot;The Africans did stop it.  The genocide was ended not by French troops,
but by the Rwanda Patriotic Front, aided by Uganda.&quot;  It was an impressive
case of <u>Pax Africana</u>, at least for a while. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Then came the problems of 1996
and early 1997 in what was then Zaire.  The Mobutu regime over-reached itself
when it tried to empower remnants of the Hutu <u>Umtirahamwa</u> in refugee

citizenship.  The </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Zairean
Tutsi--helped by Rwanda--decided to resist the intimidation of the Zairean
armed forces.  To the astonishment of everybody, the then Zairean armed forces
were a paper monkey, even less than a paper tiger.  They were easily defeated
by the Tutsi resisters.  (Zaire has of course since been renamed the Democratic
Republic of Congo.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Before long the Tutsi rebellion
became multi-ethnic.  Enter Laurent Kabila with his rendezvous with history. 
The rebellion also became multinational, aided by Rwanda, Uganda and also
Angola.  The anti-Mobutu movement was both Pan-African and trans-ethnic.  It
finally culminated in the overthrow of a dictatorship which had lasted from
1965 to 1996.  At least in ousting Mobutu Sese Seko, this was a triumph for <u>Pax
Africana</u>, though we still did not know how much of an improvement over
Mobutu Laurent Kabila would become. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The optimists saw him as another
Yoweri Museveni.  Museveni too had created a private army to challenge the
official army of the state.  Museveni's army--like that of Kabila--had defeated
the army of the state.  And then Museveni in power embarked on three strategies
of change--first, stabilization of the country; second, restoring the economic
health of the country; and third, initiating cautious democratization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Museveni has had remarkable
success in the first two goals--the quest for stability and the restoration of
the economic health of Uganda.  His progress in both has been faster than most
observers (and most Ugandans) ever expected.  His third goal of cautious
democratization is still in its early stages--but so far, so good.  (Museveni
has had less success in stabilizing Northern Uganda.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Would Laurent Kabila be another
Yoweri Museveni?  The answer still is--only if Kabila is lucky.  What is clear
is that Kabila's initial triumph would probably not have occurred without the
help of Museveni, both directly, and through Rwanda.  Kabila was also aided by
Angola and others.  For the time-being this was a success story for <u>Pax
Africana</u>, though its future may be shorter than originally anticipated. </p>

story of Liberia and the role of ECOMOG in ending its civil war and leading

for a malfunctioning brotherly state, and going into the weaker state to try
and do something about it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>ECOMOG's lack of experience,
along with disarray in Lagos, initially resulted in a lot of disastrous false

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>How do we discourage African
armies from staging military coups against democratically elected governments? 
The dilemma arose with the first Black African military coup.  This was the
coup against Sylvanus Olympio in Togo, which was also postcolonial Africa's
first presidential assassination.  This was in 1963.  The initial Pan-African
response was in boycotting the successor regime in Togo.  At the inaugural
meeting of the Organization of African Unity </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>(OAU) in 1963,
there was one vacant seat.  It was Togo's--originally intended for the
assassinated Sylvanus Olympio.  Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania wept publicly for
Olympio.  And the Charter of the newly formed O.A.U. explicitly included a
clause &quot;condemning political assassination in all its forms&quot;.  But was
anybody prepared to use force to oust the regime which had assassinated
Sylvanus Olympio?  At that time no one was.  <u>Pax Africana</u> was alive but
underdeveloped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.3pt;

later (to the month) a coup took place in Uganda.  Idi Amin </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Dada overthrew
the government of Milton Obote.  Again one of those most deeply shattered by
the event was President Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania.  He roundly condemned
the coup, and personally refused to have any dealings with Idi Amin Dada.  But
was anybody prepared to use force to try and reverse the coup?  At that time
not even Nyerere was!  <u>Pax Africana</u> was indeed sensitive, but not yet
forceful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Eight years later Julius Nyerere
was indeed prepared to use force against Idi Amin's persistent national  and regional
destabilization.  In 1979 Nyerere was at last ready to order Tanzania's army to
march all the way to Kampala to overthrow Idi Amin.  Nyerere was successful in
ousting the Ugandan dictator and in establishing a temporary Tanzanian
protectorate in Uganda before multiparty elections could be held.  Nyerere made
two mistakes in his protectorate over Uganda.  He made his <u>Pax Africana</u>
too brief, and he tried too hard to ensure the return of Milton Obote to
power.  Both decisions were catastrophic for Uganda.  The interlude of <u>Pax
Africana</u> was good but not well-focussed.  And the second Obote
administration in Uganda turned out to be a tragedy, only to be ended by Yoweri
Museveni's triumph in 1986.  By 1999 Julius K. Nyerere was asking that no
delegation be recognized at the Organization of African Unity if it represented
a military government.  He said this in a speech in Abuja, Nigeria, prior to
the presidential inauguration of General Obasanjo in May 1999. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>This was of course long after the
military coup in Sierra Leone in 1997, which overthrew the elected government
of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.  In this case <u>Pax Africana</u> took a wholly
unexpected turn.  A military government in Nigeria decided to defend, and
attempt to reinstate, a democratically elected government in Sierra Leone. 
Nigeria had intervened on behalf of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>This was certainly an improvement
on the older story of Western democracies propping up military regimes like
that of Mobutu Sese Seko--which was twice saved <u>militarily</u> by the West
in the face of a domestic challenge from its own Shaba province. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>I personally would rather see a
military regime like that of Nigeria in 1997-1998 defending democracy in Sierra
Leone, than see a democracy like that of France or the United States propping
up military dictatorships in Less Developed Countries.  Yet for the time being
the story of Sierra Leone seems to be a stalemate.  <u>Pax Africana</u> has not
yet fully triumphed, though the whole of Africa has condemned the June 1997
coup in Freetown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The idea of a Pan African
emergency force is also gathering momentum in the 1990s.  Uganda has been
centrally involved.  The Blue Eagle Project in southern Africa involved
training the troops of at least eight African countries to be in readiness for
special responsibilities in situations of political crisis.  Much of the training
initially occurred in Zimbabwe.  The Blue Eagle could develop into the ECOMOG
of Southern Africa, but with more appropriate training for a peace-keeping
role.  Here again is a potential arm of <u>Pax Africana</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>President Bill Clinton’s tour of
Africa in 1998 used Kampala as a major focus.  The Clinton Administration in
Washington has been championing a rapid crisis response African force.  It has
also been involved in training troops from countries like Senegal and Uganda
for peace-keeping roles.  The United States is also creating a Center of
Strategic Studies for Africa.  My own disagreement with the Clinton paradigm
concerns the <u>accountability</u> of the African rapid deployment force.  The
Clinton Administration would like to trace accountability ultimately to the
Security Council of the United Nations, which is itself controlled by Western
powers.  I believe that the Pan African Emergency force should be accountable
to Africa itself, through such revised institutions of the O.A.U. as Africa may
be able to devise.  Alternatively, accountability should be towards relevant
sub-regional organizations in Africa--to ECOWAS in West Africa, to SADEC in
Southern Africa, and to a newly evolving Eastern African </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Community.  Only
such an Afrocentered accountability would save <u>Pax Africana</u> from
becoming a mere extension of <u>Pax Americana</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Also relevant to the unfolding
saga of self-colonization in Africa is the hesitant hegemonic role of the
Republic of South Africa.  Within the wider picture of Pan-Africanism is an
emerging sub-theme of <u>Pax Pretoriana</u>, the muscle of Pretoria in sorting
out political crises in neighboring countries.  Sorting out Lusotho's problems
with its military is one case in point, though South Africa bungled badly in
Masero in 1998. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In fact the Republic of South
Africa is under pressure to be more active in other African crises--from
helping reconstruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo to pressuring UNITA
to stop fighting and join the democratic process in Angola.  <u>Pax Pretoriana</u>
at its best can be a branch of <u>Pax Africana</u>.  So indeed can be <u>Pax

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.8pt;

fragile.  The remaining military regimes are under pressure to democratize;
single-party systems have been giving way to multiparty systems; authoritarian

Uganda is at the constitutional crossroads.  Africa is taking hesitant steps
towards democracy.  But are these regional activities of peacekeeping themselves
part of the democratizing process?  Museveni’s Uganda is among those which have
raised these fundamental questions for Africa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Democratization within individual
African countries is only part of the process of resuming control over Africa's
destiny.  <u>Pax Africana</u> is the continental face of this

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Ideologies which are domestically
focused and ideologies which are externally oriented are part of the moving equilibrium
of Africa’s changing values.  What is at stake is good governance and the quest
for moral legitimacy.  Museveni has sought good governance and legitimacy in
keeping the state out of the economy; keeping political parties out of the
state; and keeping power out of the monarchies.  But the same Ugandan state
which is prohibited from intervening in its own economy is permitted to
intervene in neighbouring states.  Under Yoweri Museveni, the sovereignty of
borders has declined; the sovereignty of the market has risen.  The quest for a
new ideological balance in Uganda continues. </p>
