margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>I address this international conference on
<i>water</i> not as a specialist on watermanagement, but as a student of human
society and of comparative culture. I feel more comfortable discussing people
than recommending how best to protect water supplies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'> But there would be no <i>people</i> if
there were no <i>water</i>. I am therefore humbled to have been given this role

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'> But let me begin my emphasizing that
although water is a pre-condition for life itself, it can also be a destructive
force. Climate change not only threatens us with drought in some parts of the
world. Such change also threatens us with floods in other areas. We are at
risk  not only with too little water, but also with too much. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>The paradox of water in the human
condition is indeed a paradox of life itself. Water is the supreme element
without which life is impossible. But from time to time there is a tsunami or
hurricane which kills thousands. Water becomes a killer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>My state of New York has just witnessed a
devastation which killed over a hundred people and devastated the lives of

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Water has nurtured civilizations along the

cultures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>We must try and sustain the creative

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Noah’s ark was probably based on <i>fact</i>.
If so, Noah’s tsunami and flood was probably an earlier case of climate change.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Water <i>makes</i> history time and time
again. Unfortunately water also <i>destroys</i> history, when it washes away
massive historical evidence. When water kills history, we witness the
phenomenon of <i>historicide</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>In my almost 80 years of life I have been
a witness to history. I had accumulated documents and photographs of African
history — including my correspondence with African heads of state over the
decades. It took one major storm in New York state about a year ago to destroy
all this documentation of the first 50 years of independent Africa. Water
perpetrated <i>historicide</i> and destroyed my archives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>It is partly for such reasons that water
is both worshipped as mother of life and cursed as a deadly force. But let us
begin with the small scale of experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Everyday life in Africa is affected by a
convergence of three systems of values — indigenous, Islamic and Western. These
three normative systems approach the issue of water in divergent ways. On the
whole, indigenous culture is conservationist in its use of water, partly
because fetching water in rural Africa is a labour-intensive process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Western culture is extravagant in its use
of water, partly because of complex domestic needs and love of gardening and
flowers. Western culture also came with industrialization and its
water-consuming consequences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Islam was born in the desert of Arabia,
but surprisingly became <i>water-intensive</i> in many of its central rituals.
Since Planet Earth is inhabited by a billion-and-a-half Muslims, millions of
gallons of water are used every single day for the five prayers alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Policy-makers have understandably focused
on the positive aspects of water and how to protect the supply of clean water.
But policy-makers also need to address the destructive consequences of
hurricanes, floods and future rise of the global sea level, as the ice of the
North Pole continues to melt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>On a smaller scale there is also the
effect of annual rains on village homes. Modest huts are flattened, and
villages are reduced to new levels of poverty every year. As rural families
build new homes to accommodate their expanding populations, these
mudconstructions are flattened out, thus perpetuating certain forms of poverty.
Farmers are blessed when rain is on modest scale. Farmers are impoverished when
the rain floods out cultivation and destroys their homes. </p>

kills silently without ferocity. </p>

<h1>INFANT MORTALITY AND PARENTAL IMMORTALITY </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.85pt;
margin-bottom:13.65pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;line-height:107%'>Food
aid is a familiar enough concept. Water aid may be “the wave of the future.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Singing (Band Aid) or running (Sport Aid) in order to feed
those who are hungry makes good humanitarian sense. Performing for those who
are short of clean water is at least as compelling a cause. In reality, far
more African children die because of lack of clean water than because of
famine—though the silent famine is disastrous enough. The lack of clean water
is the cause of a variety of diseases, which includes cholera, bilharzias,
different forms of diarrhea, typhoid—all of them ruthless killers of children
and sometimes of adults. Malaria’s relationship with stagnant water is more
complex, but still relevant to infant mortality. Two to three million children
in Africa die every year because of diarrhea alone. Malaria claims the lives of
an additional million. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> A new hazard has entered the scene with increased
Westernisation: bottle-feeding. I took my English wife to Kenya for the first
time in 1963. She was startled to see a woman relative of mine pouring sand
into her baby’s feeding-bottle. Molly asked the relative in astonishment: “What
are you doing?” The relative answered in puzzlement: “Well, I am cleaning my
baby’s bottle, of course!” “<i>Cleaning</i> with dirty sand?” exclaimed Molly.
The idea of using sand from the pathway as a kind of “scrubbing soap” for a
baby’s bottle was one of Molly’s first culture shocks in Africa. Of course the
sand is then washed out and the bottle appears to be “scrubbed clean.” But if
the water in turn is already contaminated, the risk of polluting the baby’s
milk increases at every stage.  Contaminated water is not only a threat to the
mortality of children. It is also a threat to the immortality of parents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:1.95pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The risk multiplies further when an African mother goes
even more “modern” and uses powdered milk instead of fresh cow’s milk. The
powder is, of course, mixed with water. If the water is not clean, the infant’s
health is in danger, perhaps the infant’s life.  Curiously enough, the problem
of contaminated water in Africa is part of the population explosion. Precisely
because many children are dying, many more children are being born. Birth,
death and clean water are interlocked in the demography of Africa. Well-meaning
foreigners have often asked me why we permit a population explosion in our
continent when we have so many economic problems and a lot of starvation. The
answer lies in this convergence of forces. African values do indeed favour the
birth of many children; Western skills try to ensure their survival. African
traditions promote a high birth rate while Western medicine controls the death
rate. Water is indispensable for survival, but it is sometimes destructive in
tropical storms and tsunames. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> According to African tradition, a person’s immortality
after being buried depends upon being remembered among the living. To become an
ancestor beyond the grave requires having descendants who are still alive. To
put it in modern terms, I can never be completely dead for as long as my genes
are part of the living, part of my children and grandchildren. Some parents are
buried at sea, willingly or by enemies — as in the case of Usama bin Laden
after being killed by American troops. Usama bin Laden left behind enough
progeny to constitute a legacy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>And so having children is not only an insurance to protect
the parents in old age—it is also a way for them to safeguard their
immortality. Clean water is a precondition not only for the mortality of
children, but for the immortality of parents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But parents can be as effectively remembered by two
children as by seven, provided the two survive. Although international effort
to save Africa’s children has intensified recently, the toll of young
casualties every year is still in millions. A number of African countries have
undertaken nationwide inoculation of children and the casualty rate in the
villages is declining, but the annual carnage is still devastating. The quest
for clean water is not always successful. The poignancy of small coffins among
the luggage on public transportation in Africa is one of the meeting-points
between bereavement and deprivation; between personal pathos and poverty. If
immortality depends upon one’s blood flowing in the veins of the living,
bereaved parents suffer a double blow. The funeral of their child is partly a
funeral of themselves. The funeral is partly of their own claim to an
afterlife, as they bury their loved one today. Death in Africa is a many-sided
experience: it links the living, the dead and those yet to be born. The issue
of water affects the farmer praying for rain, affects a villager in fear of a hurricane,
affects a mother terrified of river blindness, and affects the whole of society
in quest of hygiene in water usage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In the long run, African couples have to be assured that
their first babies will survive before they can take the risk of not having any
more. The fear of infant mortality continues to affect the dream of parental
immortality. Only when African parents begin to bury fewer children will they
learn to bear fewer babies. When all is said and done, African mothers don’t
need sermons about the prevention of further births—they need the confidence
that when they leave the clinical reassurance of the hospital, and take their
babies home, death will not be lurking in the village, waiting for their little
ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The two minimal conditions for survival are hygiene and
clean water. The first— hygiene—is a matter of knowledge and understanding.
African mothers need to understand what is at stake when they cook near a
lavatory, or when they feed a baby from a bottle which has not been sterilised.
If African women are traditionally custodians of fire and water for the home,
they need to know how to mobilize fire in order to make water safe, and learn
about boiling water as a method of disinfecting. </p>

line-height:107%'>              Hygiene is sometimes part of the wider culture,
and can even be linked to religion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Muslim Africa has a complicated relationship with the
concept of “clean water.” Islam is ritually water-intensive. What defines clean
is not “fit to drink” but “fit for ablutions.” The devout Muslim prays five
times a day, and each prayer is usually preceded by the use of water for
ablutions. The African continent may have 450 million Muslims. The ablution
tradition involves wetting hands, arms, feet, head and having a mouthwash
before every prayer. At least traditionally, water is “clean” when it is
suitable for such preparation for worship. Clearly, the standards of water
suitable for sacred purposes are not the same as the standards of water
suitable for human consumption. In the modern age, many Muslim families have
indeed recognized a dual standard of cleanliness—but in much of Muslim Africa
in the rural areas, there is a belief that if water is good enough for
communication with God, it is good enough for consumption by human beings.
Water for ablutions does not have to be boiled. It simply requires careful
assessment as to whether it has been <i>ritually</i> polluted. Bird-droppings
falling in the water can be ritual pollution; but the diseased hand of a
believer is not. In terms of human dignity, this scale of values is correct;
but in terms of human health more generally, it is not necessarily so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Then there is the Muslim use of water after personal
excretion. More millions of gallons are at stake. Islam does not encourage the
use of toilet paper, and it normally prescribes the use of water itself.
Muslims believe that toilet paper does not clear everything from the relevant
part of the body after excretion or urination. Only a thorough wash of that
part of the body can restore the believer’s ritual cleanliness. This is very
hygienic in principle—but it does require that the believer subsequently clean
his left hand thoroughly after it has cleaned the anus or genitalia. Normally
this works all right, especially since orthodox Islam discourages believers
from having long fingernails. Residual excreta in the nails of the fingers of
the left hand are normally cleared away with additional washing and soap (if
soap can be afforded). But when water generally is in short supply, these
standards of thoroughness may become more lax. The risk of spreading infection
from one believer to another suddenly becomes more severe. The fingernails of
the left hand can become major carriers of contagion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> There are one billion-and-a-half Muslims on planet earth.
The religion was born in a region of the world which is relatively short of
water. The Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca and died in Medina. He unfolded a
whole new universe of values concerning water. In Africa there are at least 450
million Muslims, praying and washing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>Perhaps the most hygienic use of water
prescribed by Islam concerns sex. Between copulation and the believer’s next
prayer, a thorough wash of the body (a thorough shower) is needed. Here again
Islam is water-intensive. Every inch of the body needs washing, including the
hair. Those who need to have sex every night are therefore enjoined to have a
shower every night, after sex, for by the time of the dawn prayer, the next
morning, the believer should have got rid of his <i>janaba</i>: his unholy
condition of sexual hedonism. Only a thorough shower can get rid of <i>janaba</i>
and it is a major sin to enter a mosque before one has had his or her post-sex
shower. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> It is one of the ironies of history that a religion born
in the grandeur of the Arabian desert in all its barrenness, should have
prescribed so many ritual uses of water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Christianity seems to have the concept of a
once-and-for-all baptism for each individual. In Islam, baptism is, in a sense,
a daily affair—covering five prayers and following every act of sexuality. When
available, water in Islam is a continual ritual necessity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> In itself, all this is a contribution to hygiene. The
problem arises when water is in short supply, and short cuts are made to make
the same amount of water serve too many purposes. A little pond near the
village may be used to too many believers to get rid of their post-sex <i>janaba</i>.
If one of the believers is diseased, the danger of infection occurs. Islam is,
indeed, a religion of cleanliness; but it also recognizes that ritual
cleanliness is no substitute for real hygienic understanding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Even the understanding of hygiene is not enough if it is
not accompanied by actual availability of clean water. Contaminated water is
often a killer. They say that in much of Africa it is easier to get a bottle of
good beer than a glass of clean water. Things are not made easier by Western
companies dumping on Africa powdered milk which is then mixed with unclean
water. Rural mothers are being diverted away from the healthier tradition of
breast-feeding. Africa needs birth control far less than it needs <i>death</i>
control. We need family planning far less than family survival. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> And yet, in spite of all this death and devastation,
Africa is the fastest-growing continent in the world, in terms of population.
Droughts come and go, famine hits and retreats, disease is ever-present in our
midst, civil disorder takes its toll—and yet a new and larger generation of
Africans is in the making all the time. There is enough clean water to keep
population growing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> I am a citizen of a country (Kenya) which at times has led
the world in population growth. I am a native of a continent which is the
vanguard of human fertility. And yet the world is staging spectacular singing
and sporting events to save us from starvation and death. Why is the land of
fertility also the land of famine? Why is a people of fecundity endowed with a
continent of barrenness? It does not seem to be fair. It does not even make
sense. Yet all is not lost if we are capable of such astonishing growth rates
and if we can replace our dead so convincingly. Perhaps part of the explanation
lies in the continuing resilience of the African family, in the mutual support
it fosters among its members, and in that incredible love for children which is
the hallmark of this remarkable continent. After all, the first human child
ever was born there, a million years ago. You could say we invented the family.
The tradition continues. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> But we continue to need the protection of clean water if
the family is to be strengthened, and more young ones be served. Next time we
run on behalf of Africa, and are ready for a nice, cool drink of clean water at
the end of the “race,” let us spare a thought for those to whom such a healthy
drink is still a mere dream, a luxury for the future. </p>
