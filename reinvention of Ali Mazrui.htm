issues.” “The African political scientist who sparked controversy.” This was
how <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>The Times</i> of London respectively described
Ali Mazrui shortly after his death in October 2014. That Mazrui thrived on
controversy is widely known. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>The image of Mazrui portrayed by
Malawian scholar Paul Zeleza in his intervention at the Ali Mazrui 10th
anniversary virtual webinar last month is, however, quite different. Just as
Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr have often been shorn of their radicalism
in much of contemporary analyses, Zeleza’s Mazrui seems to be ideologically
compatible with an eclectic motley crew of diverse scholars, revealing a
cardboard cutout of the Kenyan scholar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'> Precisely because Zeleza is a
widely respected academic and administrator whose work could have a great
impact, particularly on younger scholars, we wish to challenge the portrayal of
the Kenyan academic in his 18-page essay, The Enduring Legacy of Ali Mazrui:
Commemorating an </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt;text-indent:0in'>Intellectual
Griot.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'> Zeleza purports to discuss
comparatively Mazrui’s scholarship and that of 28 other thinkers: his
predecessors, contemporaries and successors. The task could not be nobler, but
Zeleza largely fails to achieve his stated goals of placing the Kenyan intellectual
within the context of his ancestral and contemporary influences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>We might classify Zeleza’s sins
into two parts: sins of commission and sins of omission. Sins of commission are
largely misinterpretations or distortions of what Mazrui has written, while
sins of omission are fundamental facts that are overlooked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Zeleza correctly notes that:
“Mazrui’s most well-known concept of the Triple Heritage [was] articulated in
his book and television series <i>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</i> (1986).”
Mazrui, however, never critiqued the imposition of Western liberalism on
African societies resulting in a scepticism of Western-style democracy, as
Zeleza claims in seeking to align the Kenyan’s views to those of Nigerian
scholar Claude Ake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Mazrui’s position was more
nuanced. While he was strongly anti-colonialist, he was only mildly
anti-capitalist. He genuinely believed that capitalism was the mother of both
imperialism (of which he disapproved) and liberal democracy (which he admired
in theory, but felt was hypocritically practised by Western nations,
particularly in their support of foreign autocrats and maltreatment of black
minorities at home).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Zeleza suggests that Mazrui’s
advocacy of pan-Africanism was consistent with that of individuals such as
America’s WEB du Bois and Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah. Zeleza could have further
clarified the different shades of meaning in which the term is understood, as
well as how Mazrui’s own thinking of the concept evolved, by drawing on the
Kenyan’s rich typology of pan-Africanism elaborated in detail in his seminal
1977 book, <i>Africa’s International Relations: The Diplomacy of Dependency and
Chang</i>e.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Zeleza links Nkrumah’s ideas on
pan-Africanism and neo-colonialism to Mazrui’s, but fails to interrogate the
Kenyan scholar’s most contentious debate, which was centred on Nkrumah.
Mazrui’s most influential article, Nkrumah: The Leninist Czar? published in
1966 shortly after Nkrumah’s fall from power, depicted the Ghanaian leader as a
“Leninist czar”: a royalist revolutionary who had helped pioneer one-party rule
in Africa and ruled in a monarchical fashion that lost the organisational
effectiveness of a Leninist party structure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Mazrui was widely vilified by
leftists and pan-Africanists for what many felt, at the time, was a treacherous
pro-imperialist critique of an African liberation icon.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Zeleza also highlights Wole
Soyinka sharing Mazrui’s beliefs on the importance of African intellectual and
cultural autonomy, without noting the fundamental differences between the two
scholars evident in their ferocious debate of 1991-92 in which Soyinka accused
Mazrui of an Islamophilic slant in his 1986 nine-part documentary <i>The
Africans</i>, berating the Kenyan scholar for underplaying the damage of the
Arab slave trade on Africa, and for trivialising and misrepresenting African
indigenous cultures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Among Mazrui’s intellectual
successors named by Zeleza are such eccentric choices as Ghana’s George
Ayitteh, African-American Henry Louis Gates Jr  and Cameroon’s </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt;text-indent:0in'>Achille Mbembe.
Ayitteh is a conservative scholar who disproportionately focuses attention on
African tyrants and domestic deficiencies and thus blames Africa for its own
failures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Mazrui, in stark contrast,
consistently blamed historical and contemporary external forces for most of
Africa’s problems, without ignoring domestic autocracy. In 2000, Mazrui
scathingly critiqued Gates’ six-part documentary <i>Wonders of the African
World</i>  for portraying ancient Egyptians as racist; ignoring Swahili
experts; overplaying Muslim atrocities in Zanzibar; and under-playing Jewish
commercial involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.8pt;margin-bottom:10.55pt;
margin-left:0in'>Cameroon’s Achille Mbembe was described by the Malawian
scholar Thandika Mkandawire as representing “an obscurantist anti-‘victimology’
discourse”, and has more recently acted as an academic ambassador for French
President Emmanuel Macron’s neo-colonial efforts in Africa: a far cry from
Mazrui’s dyedin-the-wool pan-Africanism. </p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt;text-indent:0in'>n terms of
Mazrui’s contemporary influences, Zeleza lists writers like Nigeria’s Chinua
Achebe, Kenya’s </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt;text-indent:12.1pt'>Ngugi wa
Thiong’o and Ghana’s Ayi Kwei Armah, but fails to note Nigeria’s greatest poet,
Christopher Okigbo, on whom Mazrui wrote his only novel: <i>The Trial of
Christopher Okigbo</i>, in 1971. Mazrui’s focus on literature also tended to be
a global and not just a continental one that sought to use authors like
Shakespeare, Milton and Kipling to illuminate the African condition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Among Mazrui’s closest
intellectual collaborators within his peers were Nigeria’s Ade Ajayi and
Jamaica’s Dudley Thompson, with whom he campaigned relentlessly on the issue of
reparations to Global Africa for the European-led transatlantic slave trade and
colonialism. All three panAfrican intellectuals also served on the Organisation
of African Unity’s Group of Eminent Persons established in 1992. Zeleza
mentions none of this. Furthermore, some of the political figures he identifies
like Amilcar Cabral were not as central to Mazrui’s scholarship as Tanzania’s
Julius Nyerere, Uganda’s Milton Obote and Idi Amin, Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser,
Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi and later, South Africa’s Nelson Mandela and America’s
Barack Obama, none of whom are mentioned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Zeleza has thus omitted
individuals who would have to form an integral part of any serious discussion
of Mazrui’s scholarship. Zeleza’s list appears arbitrary, and even he himself
concedes that it is based on “impressionistic selectivity” (apparently because
it is no easy task to capture in a short essay the essence of Mazrui’s
intellectual output of 58 books and 679 academic articles). Many of these
scholars and statesmen, we think, are perhaps those that Zeleza himself
admires. They are not the ones that were major influences on, and disciples of,
Mazrui.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>Zeleza then outlines 10 of
Mazrui’s most important ideas, but fails to mention perhaps his most
influential: Pax Africana. This was a concept that the Kenyan told us he was
most proud to have coined. The idea is developed in Mazrui’s very first book <i>Towards
A Pax Africana: A Study of Ideology and Ambition</i> (1967 ) in which he argued
for Africa to craft its own self-pacification mechanisms to avoid pernicious
interventions by external actors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>This study remains a foundational
text of Africa’s international relations and conflict resolution, but somehow
does not make it into Zeleza’s top 10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'> Some of the comprehensive work
in the rich treasure of Mazruiana that would also have been helpful for Zeleza
to have  mentioned is Mazrui’s 2014 <i>African Thought in Comparative
Perspective</i>, and in reference to his discussion on  Mazrui’s contributions
to feminist thought, the late Kenyan scholar’s 2014 <i>The Politics of Gender
and the Culture of Sexuality</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>But what should not be overlooked
is who is also missing from Zeleza’s account: the Ali Mazrui we know who loved
to argue, generate controversy and stimulate ideas. Where is the Mazrui who
made a name for himself by challenging conventional wisdom? Where is the Mazrui
who once said “my life itself is one long debate”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>The Mazrui we knew was also
different from Zeleza’s Mazrui in another sense. The Kenyan intellectual was  a
storyteller, the master of paradox, the master comparativist, the master of
metaphor, the master verbal gymnast, a master jargonbuster, a master inventor
of words, and a master classifier. This “multiple Mazrui” is mostly missing
from Zeleza’s interesting essay.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'> In short, Zeleza’s
interpretation of the “enduring legacy” of Mazrui vastly overplays the
connections between Mazrui’s scholarship and that of his predecessors,
contemporaries and successors. The Kenyan had noted in 1991: “My own worldview
does not fit into any particular … school. That is why I am attacked from [all
directions.]”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.8pt'>In the Hereafter, which he dubbed
“After Africa”, Mazrui himself would be unlikely to recognise Zeleza’s
reinvention and caricature of Africa’s most eloquent griot and the black
Atlantic’s master essayist.</p>
